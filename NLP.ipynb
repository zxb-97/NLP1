This is a really good buy for anyone who wants to do office work with a large amount of RAM and good speeds, whether work or educational it’s great. No issues with set up, windows keys worked with no problems. Has the ability to upgrade to windows 11 and couldn’t be happier with this product overall. Battery life is a good 3 and half hours (so it says). Bought this because of the model and disk drive capabilities with lots of multimedia functions. It does weigh quite heavily, you should know that in case you were deciding to shoulder strap bag it on a big or commute. Overall great purchase, defo recommend  for a family member who may not be computer literate.', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2021', 'verified': 'Not Verified'}),\n",

I knew roughly delivery date - it was delivered bang on time by the way - but would have been great given the delivery details, tracker number etc.  I chased this and was given day before delivery date - perhaps me being impatient and a very, very minor quibble.Laptop arrived in very secure packaging and, with the exception that the box was plain rather than Lenovo branded, you could easily be fooled this was a brand new device.  Not a scratch, no wear on the keys, screen looks perfect and mint condition.  Device was extremely clean and smelled fresh... I know odd comment but I guess it was wiped thoroughly with a citrus wipe or similar perhaps due to Covid19.On booting up, was really fast and had the advertised storage space, RAM etc.  Perhaps this is me being IT illiterate but I had to load my own version of Microsoft Office.  Office was on there but a demo/online version where you then had to buy 365.  I’m still a 2010 bloke so easily booted that up and all running really quickly.  In fact there’s another version of office tools installed but I didn’t recognise the make - therefore could be a version already for those who don’t have Office already installed?!I’ve put 4 stars on battery as I’m uncertain if it is brand new but if original then this device is a few years old.  Therefore expecting a shorter battery life than a brand new battery but they can be easily, and relatively cheaply, replaced.What more can I say at this stage?  For just under £240 for a very decent, solidly built ex-business model packed with 256 SSD, 16gb RAM and i5 processor is an absolute bargain and one I would definitely recommend!', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 March 2020', 'verified': 'Not Verified'}\n",

I knew roughly delivery date - it was delivered bang on time by the way - but would have been great given the delivery details, tracker number etc.  I chased this and was given day before delivery date - perhaps me being impatient and a very, very minor quibble.Laptop arrived in very secure packaging and, with the exception that the box was plain rather than Lenovo branded, you could easily be fooled this was a brand new device.  Not a scratch, no wear on the keys, screen looks perfect and mint condition.  Device was extremely clean and smelled fresh... I know odd comment but I guess it was wiped thoroughly with a citrus wipe or similar perhaps due to Covid19.On booting up, was really fast and had the advertised storage space, RAM etc.  Perhaps this is me being IT illiterate but I had to load my own version of Microsoft Office.  Office was on there but a demo/online version where you then had to buy 365.  I’m still a 2010 bloke so easily booted that up and all running really quickly.  In fact there’s another version of office tools installed but I didn’t recognise the make - therefore could be a version already for those who don’t have Office already installed?!I’ve put 4 stars on battery as I’m uncertain if it is brand new but if original then this device is a few years old.  Therefore expecting a shorter battery life than a brand new battery but they can be easily, and relatively cheaply, replaced.What more can I say at this stage?  For just under £240 for a very decent, solidly built ex-business model packed with 256 SSD, 16gb RAM and i5 processor is an absolute bargain and one I would definitely recommend!', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 March 2020', 'verified': 'Not Verified'}\n",

I knew roughly delivery date - it was delivered bang on time by the way - but would have been great given the delivery details, tracker number etc.  I chased this and was given day before delivery date - perhaps me being impatient and a very, very minor quibble.Laptop arrived in very secure packaging and, with the exception that the box was plain rather than Lenovo branded, you could easily be fooled this was a brand new device.  Not a scratch, no wear on the keys, screen looks perfect and mint condition.  Device was extremely clean and smelled fresh... I know odd comment but I guess it was wiped thoroughly with a citrus wipe or similar perhaps due to Covid19.On booting up, was really fast and had the advertised storage space, RAM etc.  Perhaps this is me being IT illiterate but I had to load my own version of Microsoft Office.  Office was on there but a demo/online version where you then had to buy 365.  I’m still a 2010 bloke so easily booted that up and all running really quickly.  In fact there’s another version of office tools installed but I didn’t recognise the make - therefore could be a version already for those who don’t have Office already installed?!I’ve put 4 stars on battery as I’m uncertain if it is brand new but if original then this device is a few years old.  Therefore expecting a shorter battery life than a brand new battery but they can be easily, and relatively cheaply, replaced.What more can I say at this stage?  For just under £240 for a very decent, solidly built ex-business model packed with 256 SSD, 16gb RAM and i5 processor is an absolute bargain and one I would definitely recommend!', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 March 2020', 'verified': 'Not Verified'}\n",
