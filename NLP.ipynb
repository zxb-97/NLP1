In fact there’s another version of office tools installed but I didn’t recognise the make - therefore could be a version already for those who don’t have Office already installed?!I’ve put 4 stars on battery as I’m uncertain if it is brand new but if original then this device is a few years old.  Therefore expecting a shorter battery life than a brand new battery but they can be easily, and relatively cheaply, replaced.What more can I say at this stage?

The laptop loaded both lightroom and photoshop very quickly and the lag between me carrying out an edit on an image, and what appeared on the screen, was barely perceptible. I was also impressed with the speed photos were moved from lightroom into photoshop for further editing. Again, the speed was very quick, taking only a few seconds to open up photoshop and 'dump' the photo I wanted to edit into the photoshop app. I should point out that I was using the very latest Lightroom and Photoshop apps.With the SSD hard drive being so small in modern terms and no traditional hard drive to back it up, I have had to get used to using the cloud to store documents etc. and probably helped me to get into the 21st century of doing things like this.Although the Lenovo ThinkTank t430 is a few years old now (it was originally loaded with Windows 7, but now has Windows 10), the Photoshop editing tools showed me that this laptop is more than capable of dealing with the latest, power intensive apps that is out there.
