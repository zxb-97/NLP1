Richard,5,very good product and service.,very good product and service will refer a friend.
Scheu,5,Good selection.,Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times.
Shanner732,5,Exactly what I wanted,This kindle is a basic and easy to use eReader. Exactly what I wanted. The charge lasts for a long time so you don't have to worry about charging it daily.
LMoTX,3,Good but not great,Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.
paulinhala,3,OK,It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!
Steve,5,Great kindle.,Very good reading on this good and strong quality kindle
llyyue,3,Too small,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
Wheels,5,Love it!,I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.
MrPhilTX,4,Great reader but not perfect,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
Bubba,5,Love to read,I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month
Shashi,4,Great buy if you read a lot,"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light."
steve,5,Great kindle,Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend
nhojmcqueen,4,Great Gift For The Bookworm!!!,The Amazon Kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. The lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. Great product for your money!!
CrAZyMom,5,Kindle for my kid,"In trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. First I got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon."
DowntownBrown,5,Great reader,The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can't carry around a lot of books.
YogiGG,5,Replacing old Kindle,Great buy! Bought it to replace a first generation Kindle.
Eleanor,5,Love it,"Perfect size, so easy to carry around. Long lasting battery life. Would reccomend!"

Chris,5,Great kindle,My wife likes it because she can read all different kind of books
cruiser007,5,PERFECT,FOR ITS SIZE IF OK THE VALUE MY WIFE LOVE IT SHE USE IT ALL THE TIME
DragonHawk1960,3,Feels cheap,In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.
Dottie,5,A great deal on a Kindle!,I am enjoying my Kindle very much! Easy to down load books and easy to read! Very happy with my purchase!
Momo,4,Better than reading on my phone...,I bought the Amazon Kindle so I could enjoy reading without lugging around multiple books. I usually read my ebooks on the Kindle app but I have gotten frustrated with my phone/tablet going into sleep mode. This Kindle is sufficient for my needs. I purchased a reading light for when I'm in low-light situations and it works very well. I am satisfied with my purchase.
Jeff,4,Great product,My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
nhojmcqueen,4,Great Gift For The Bookworm!!!,The Amazon Kindle is a great device to enjoy reading before bed. The device is small and lightweight which is better than holding onto a heavier tablet.
BestBuyUser,3,Good for beginners,"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it."
nolancin,5,Great ebook reader,"Super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, I've tried many e-readers but I'll definitely stick to this one."
Theresa,4,Great Kindle quality for a reasonable price.,"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle."
edmr,5,Has all I need,It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place...
IwasCold,4,Good reader,"This is my first e-reader. I like it so far. Easy to use interface. The ads can be kind of annoying, but keeps cost lower."
Karch,4,Nice ereader,Nice basic reader. Had the first model kindle and this is quite a bit lighter
ThisClickAintFree,5,Simple and easy to read,"Great starter eReader, very simply does what it's made to do."
JuneFlo,4,Great device for reading,Great way to read books available for downloads from the library
RH1234,5,Fantastic E Reader,"This Kindle has no extra bells or whistles that would cause major battery drainage. Sometimes less is more. No distractions to keep you from reading, no backlights to fatigue your eyes. Be aware that you can't read this Kindle in the dark.Pretty simple to operate. FYI there is no wall plug adapter for this unit only the USB cord that plugs into the Kindle, and computer for charging. You can buy an adapter separately. If you have the Kindle Fire HDX that adapter works with this kindle. You can use that adapter to charge it from the electrical outlet.I recently purchased this Kindle. I do have had other Kindles, and enjoy them immensely.I purchased this one for outdoor use.So far I Love it!"
mao1,5,easy to use,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!"
Daniel,3,Font size changes with no way to lock it,There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.
Stuart,5,"Simple, competent reader for Kindle books","After using a series of low end tablets as an e-Reader, I purchased this on sale for $50. It only really does one thing - display Kindle books in normal lighting, but it does it well.Size, feel, and battery life are all good, and unlike LCD-based tablets it is easy to read outside. The Amazon lock-screen ads are not that intrusive, and easy to ignore."
nonny,5,replacement kindle,this item is a great upgrade from my last kindle.everything is touch screen and is faster than before
chi20,4,Light and portable,This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well.
nikb,4,Great !! But the UI could be better,"This is a great product, my 8yr son is completely hooked onto it. The only change I would say it making the interface a little easier to use."
Gladys,5,Favorite version so far,"I've owned a couple of Kindles. This one is my favorite thus far. The screen is a little too sensitive for my liking but other than that, great!"
davidjacobs21,5,Great Reader,Got this on sale for a great price and is a great product.
iPhone5SReview,5,Nicely designed for its intended usage,"Small, light easy to read in any lighting. If you are looking for a device that serves one purpose, to read books anywhere, this is for you."
Tarun,5,Nice reading device,I am happy as i bought it for reading and it is good.
MacFam,4,Good to have,"I am very happy with my e-reader. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. she has one as well, and we use them to read every night as required by her 4th grade class curriculum."
drd1,5,Great reading tool,I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.
Tdobby13,5,great upgrade,"I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it."
Dani,5,Great product,Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.
kimsanity,4,Great Value,This little device is great for it price. Lots of features.
geeglobes,5,Good ereader. Great for when I travel.,"At first I thought my reader was broken but discovered, by accident, that my touch must be very light."
shop12,5,new features make reading easier,"I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come"
hlmjbm,5,Great product for travel,I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.
Adams,5,Good,I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.
RDDG,5,Kindle,"Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product."
Robe12,4,Good Deal for the Price,The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use.
geoshox,5,Perfect read,Very useful for night time reading responsive and intuitive display
mike5800,4,Family Sharing Tool,"Use the Kindle apps on Android phones and tablets, but apps don't support family sharing. These Kindles are great (and inexpensive) for that purpose."
randy,4,love the kindle,"my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement"
jjhippo,5,Good price excellent reader,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.
Spartan51,5,Makes reading easier,"Overall good product, bought two for my parents and they loved it!"
Dissatisfied,1,HATE IT!!!!!,Am used to Kindle Fire which I love. No light to read by in the dark. Hard to navigate. This was a gift - would never purchase on my own.
irratated,5,My Lifesaver,I absolutely LOVE my kindle. I go nowhere without it. It has kept me entertained for hours. Don't have to keep up with books that get torn or lost. I would and DO RECOMMEND a kindle for EVERYONE
elpj56,5,Exactly what I needed,This is what I needed not fancy just simply used for reading books. Easy to use and battery lasts for quite a while.
Juj14,4,Loving it!,"I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare."
johnjohn,5,great update,"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update."
Albert,5,Great for price,It very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or
wcy405100,5,nice gift,It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.
Bertram,5,"Nice item, great price",I had always been looking to upgrade my original Kindle. I love the new touch features and display on this one. The size also makes it very easy to transport.
Msimon,4,For mom,"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
quickshot,4,works well easy to see,I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.
horseman,5,"I've had one before, so I knew I'd be happy","I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go."
Rusty,4,Great entry level e-reader,"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent."
cookie1982,5,good for my teenager,Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient
mother,4,good design,I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased
PauloRS,4,Excellent for readers,"I always wanted one of those, but they were too expensive compared to a tablet. But now I am loving it!"
Amazon,5,Great e reader,"Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use."
Andrea,4,My Second Kindle,"This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'Goggle' info on her phone."
Fievel22,3,Good for the price,"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good."
natick,5,good product and quick service,My nephew is going to high school and the kindle is a great gift for him. Bestbuy has good selection and the price is good too!
Ravi,5,Great e-Reader for a beginner,I had read reviews. It is just like what reviews said. It is really good. I still have to try some features. Probably I should have gone for Kindle Light. Maybe next time. But for now I am totally satisfied.
Hokie24,5,"Great for our daughter, she loves it.","Perfect for our young daughter, its a perfect size and she can use it very easily."
Ravi,3,Screen Size could be bigger,The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.
Missy,5,Great for reading.,Love not having to carry books and being able to get a variety of books.
JediMaster,5,"Not bad, little pricy","It's a great product, I would buy another for a family member. I do hope they lower the price a little in the future"
rmwarriors,5,Good ebook,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.
lopez,5,good product,"I love this kindle, the price is good, not too heavy and I charge once every two weeks"
WINDY,4,NEW AND IMPROVED,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two."
pasas,5,best for reading!!!!!!!!!!,"im loving this Amazon kindle reader, its the easy one to use."
flexorcist,4,Great Product,"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader."
Mickey,2,"The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust it","The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness"
Santi10721,5,Gift,I've got this as a gift for my grandmother and she's not tech savvy but she can work a kindle. She loves to read and is very pleased with it.
shhimreading,5,Simple and Easy To Use,"I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this."
Bill,4,Work,Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
Gadgets,5,Good beginners reader,This is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day...you will not be able to read in the dark
Hoagies5,5,Super sweet little reader,We open the box. We download a book. It's like magic. The words the phrases the complete sentences. So cool!!!
Pritha,5,You will love it,This is a great product. Light weight. I wish it has wifi to download from online.
noname,5,good product,My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.
Mktg,5,perfect for reading for my child,purchased for my child to read - works as expected and for the price it was a good option
Staysee,5,Replaced my old kindle with this one,"I really enjoy the basic amazon kindle and best buy had a great deal on it when I purchased it. It's very easy on the eyes and there is no glare when reading outside even on a sunny day just as advertised. It has the look of book in that sense. I was able to order this online and ""pick up in store"" and it was very convenient because I was low on time. I highly recommend this product to any avid reader and anyone looking to make the jump to an eReader. A few other great features are the long battery life, it's light and small and very easy to take on the go."
Bearsfan,5,Love the product,I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me
Chris,3,Good for books,The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading
princess84314,5,Now I can have all of the books!,"My first e-reader, and I have been filling it up fast. Great for travel!"
danielson,5,Love it.,"Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed."
Arnab,4,Works Best for Avid Readers,"BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle."
hiyasar,4,Nice affordable e-reader,"Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight"
Hikjer,5,Love the touch screen,"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
Maypop,4,Easily down loaded.,Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read
MrNJ,5,Good replacement for old devices,"This was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party e-reader. It is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. The Kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. The one draw back for some people may be that the lock-screen has ads. This is only on the lock-screen, the ads don't appear while using the device and Amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee."
Ajweb5,4,It was a gift for our mother.,It was easy to se up but the recipient wished it has an actual manual that you didn't have to download to print a copy. She has yet to use it outside due to weather at this time.
Priyesh3d3,5,Nice Product of Kindle begineers,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models."
Reader,4,Great size and quality,Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around
Staticclark,4,Incredible,"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend."
Junior,4,Good price,This was a gift for my girlfriend. She loved due to the fact that it was small and compacted ..
Erii,5,Love my Kindle,It allows me to read without using space in my phone.

shibu,4,Good,"Good, but unhappy that screen size is small, less than I expected"
Chillypr,3,Does its job,It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
Anton,4,Gets It Done,"The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect."
MDeezyH2,5,Perfect,My first Kindle and I love it. No backlight and perfect view in the sun are awesome.
BeeRocker,5,Great for reading on the go,"I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers."
thehands,5,Finally started reading again,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up."
wyosun,5,Excellent reader,This is a great quality reader. Print on it is very clear and it is easy to use.
Splorticus,5,Great mid-range Kindle,"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars."
kkai,3,Reading device,"I bought it cause I wanted to read more. That didn't happen, I tried and I just can't read on devices I need old school paper between my hands"
Ed51648,5,A Terrific and Highly Appreciated Gift,I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!
kdla,4,Great,"I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome"
2112,5,It is what it is,"Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school"
tmcg,3,Can it be used with the library?,It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.
Tupiman,5,Great product at great price.,I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.
LoveTech,4,"Good reader, charge lasts forever.","This is the perfect reader. Price is great, it's easy on your eyes. Battery lasts longer than a tablet."
Andy,5,This is a great reader!,"At first I was a bit skeptical about the sensitivity of the touch screen on these new kindles, but it has been great. The reading is very smooth and I am quite please with this purchase."
Rain,5,Nice ereader,"Just what I needed, lightweight and easy to download books from the library"
FlavaDizzave,5,kids love their Kindles,easy for my kids - 8 and 11 to use the kindle for night time reading
newkindle,4,easy to use / easy to start,First time user - had no problem getting started - must have internet connection and know name and password for wi-fi
ApplePicker,4,Great for the park or the beach.,"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did."
1981,4,easy on the eyes,easy on the eyes and perfect for travel. battery life is a +
Sandycheeks,5,Great size for travel,"I love how compact this kindle is, I'm able to put it in my gym bag, backpack, and my purse. The screen is a plain white which is great for reading because you don't get a glare, I just wish Best Buy offered a case for it I had to purchase one from amazon."
Eddeb3,5,Kindle - Great Digital Book,So simple to set up a caveman could do it and still have time to get some reading in!
ArmyNINJA,5,Great device to kill time!,Kindle just keeps getting better. This device is the perfect size to pack away for a business trip to kill some time reading a book or even uploading your documents to access them quickly.
Lish,5,Awesome Kindle,"I love this kindle. I've never had one before but I would definitely recommend one to those that are avid or casual readers. No glare, easy to use, easy to bring anywhere."
steven,5,Gives you all it promised,"I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time."
Charmi,5,Great light reader. Easy to use at the beach,This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!

JAY10001,5,Great product,Excellent base model e-reader. Nice to use inside or outside.
merry,4,not good quality,I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
Ckkparker,3,"Amazon Kindle, Black","For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire."
Updt,5,Awesome,"It's exactly what you'd think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking."

Rswd10,5,Reading is cool,Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .
TXphotog,5,"Great size, battery is awesome!","What can I say, if you enjoy books and magazines it's hard to beat. Not backlit but not an issue for me. I take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much."
ReadingMachine76,4,Could be better,"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly."
yhmitchell,5,Great Product,"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle."
Flipbrickz888,5,Great as advertised,If you are into reading then this is for you. I didn't think the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room. Great for reading outside.
Jpan5447,5,Great E-Reader,This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.
Lexx,5,Love it!,I love how portable this Kindle is. It fits right in my purse and makes it so I can read whenever and wherever I have free time.

MusicMan,4,The home screen is not terribly easy to navigate.,"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book."
Jackie,5,Great readers,Good product for child. Who only need to read the books
johnjohn,5,Child loves her Kindle,"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous."
Mark,4,Good reader,"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model."
Kathy,5,Easy and simple,Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.
st2005,5,Great e-reader for beginners,"Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device"
jerseygirl,4,Kindle,"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me."
Alber,4,It's good,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.
Cubfan,5,LOVE MY KINDLE,"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!"
simba,3,too many bells and whistles,"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet"
Beachbuckeye,5,Perfect for kids,"My daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books."
LenTaylorWrites,5,Great Daytime Reader,If you want to read anytime where there's a light source this is thereafter for you. If you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper considering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model.
JeremyRem,4,Present for my dad,"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store."
TinLexington,5,Good Product,"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use."
JimA,4,Great,"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun."
Gifter,2,Lots of problems. Want my old one back,1st kindle screen failed & had to reboot often. Customer Service couldn't fix. Replaced. 2nd one screen reboots often. Customer service offered replace. Just want one that works. Can't get upgrade replacement
nest1819,3,No like,This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me
ddrraz,5,great device,Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.
MARKNER,5,Amazing device for the price!,I used to prefer paper or hardback books but found I had more access to read online. With the kindle I have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.
Karthik,5,Best buy,Got it to gift to my friend. Absolutely loved it. Good value.
Yo40,5,Kindle,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.
Mawcee,5,The lighting is great,I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.
Chelsea,5,Great!,I love this kindle! It's a life saver when I'm bored at the doctors office!
Steve,5,great for reading,i liked t because its not harmful to my eye like the monitor or the mobile its the best choice for reading
raulsk,5,Much better than previous generation,Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM
MrNewYork,4,Totally does the job,"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem."
Chipper,5,Excellent product,I've been using a Kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one as a Birthday present. Very excited recipient!
Lttommy,5,Great for people who like to read,Very easy to use and with amazon have loads of books to access
AB79,5,Great for book reader,Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend
Nickname,5,Great,Great. Great quality. It's like reading a real book
Luigi,5,Great Kindle,"Great kindle for my needs, it is easy to use and comfortable."
Tigger,5,Love kindle,Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can't Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night.
Bigdave,4,Great to start reading ebooks on.,The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.
Linda,5,Wonderful product for a senior.,I bought this for my mom. The type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading !
LeeT,5,Great inexpensive e-reader,The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.
Boby,5,My daughter loves,Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches
Tfisher,4,Love my kindle,"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work"
Stu76,5,Great reader with long battery life,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet."
Abie,5,Great kindle,easy to use and has enough space. I highly recommend this product. Also a great gift
GANESH,5,Excellent Product,I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance.
Sean242,5,feels like a real book,"Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book."
Azcokindleaddict,4,Love the kindle,"This is my second kindle. As I travel a lot, I love the ability to get electronic versions of books both through Amazon and my local library."
Alberto,4,It's great but you need to pay extra for ad free,The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that
Kimmie,4,Great for the price,First kindle debated between this one I got and the back lit version. Very pleased It's compact easy to tote. Using at the beech this week. I have Amazon prime so I get free downloads on books . It is easy to use . I think I would definitely recommend this product to others.
Chris,5,Great little device,"Wasn't a fan of having to get one of these (I'm kinda old school...I like book) but, it really was a nice device. Easy to use and read from. Glad I got it!"
clickz4,,Compare FIRE HD to the KINDLE FIRE GEN 2,"UPDATE: I bought both a Fire HD and a Gen 2. (as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the Kindle system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation Fire.The new Kindle Fire and Fire HD are the second generation color kindle e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original Fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The Fire HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Amazon but they really are solid feeling.- FIRE HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- FIRE GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the Fire. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE.Read more"
Me,,Best value,"I just received my kindle fire today. I had a hard time deciding between the HD, this, and the paperwhite. I decided on this one, because I really thought I'd like the immersion reading. I have an audible account and I've been reading along to the audiobooks. It's amazing how fast I can get through the books (at 3x speed) and I really retain the info. The immersion reading is super-easy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this. The whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time. I'm an average-speed reader and was able to read 4 books (with the help of the audiobook reading pace) in the last 30 days and one was the 800+ page Stephen king, 11/22/63.I also tested out the text to speech. It's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard. It also has many speed options and I think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version. I am very, very pleased with it.It is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire I'm upgrading from.If you are worried about the free offers, don't be. I DETEST commercials and advertising so much, I quit reading magazines and watching television. The offers only show on the startup, no big deal. I already took advantage of a 5.00 credit for amazon video. I was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and I was planning on renting Hunger Games tonight, anyway. So, so far, I don't mind the offers at all.My favorite feature is the immersion reading and the text-to-speech improvements. I also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.Read more"
Lisa,,Wonderful product and incredible support from Amazon!,"I purchased the Kindle Fire ten months ago for my daughter. Three weeks after she got it, it was stolen. Amazon worked with our police department to find the person who had taken it. Amazon first put a hold on the person's account and shut down the Kindle Fire so it wouldn't work. Then, once Amazon had a subpoena, Amazon gave the police all the information the thief had registered to my daughter's Kindle Fire and the police were able to recover it and get it back to us. Since that time, we have purchased an additional Kindle Fire and, just recently, a Kindle Fire HD. We use them like iPads at a fraction of the cost and the number of free books and apps available is unmatched by their competitors. Our oldest Kindle Fire (ten months old) just stopped charging and I contacted Amazon via Live Chat. Immediately, they said they would send me a replacement Kindle Fire and would also email me a printing label for free shipping to return the defective one. Their customer service is incredible! The Kindle Fire itself is amazing. The internet is fast connects perfectly to all wi-fi the graphics are clear and sharp the books and apps offered are endless. My teenager listens to Pandora on it constantly. I'm always reading. My husband checks the sports scores. My young sons are always playing the game apps. We have them protected in KlearKase protectors and have found them to be well-made, quality devices. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a Kindle Fire to anyone of my friends and family."
Old School Working Mom,,Great product but they get you with the ads and missing accessories,"My 7 year old son has the 1st gen Kindle Fire, and we've been very happy with it. He mostly plays games on it now, but we plan to purchase more movies and books for it in the future. My 5 year old wanted one too, so we just purchased the 2nd gen Kindle Fire for her. She had been saving her allowance and birthday money this whole year for it. We purchased one the day they were announced!We've had it now for 3 days... and while it's still the same great product, we were disappointed to find (after receiving the device) that the 2nd generation Fire comes WITHOUT a wall charger (which the first gen Fire had) and has a whole mess of ads loaded onto it. My 5 year old can't read very well yet - she couldn't figure out how to get rid of the ads, and was constantly yelling for me to come help her. Also, some of the ads featured more mature themes (ads for sexy prime time tv shows, for example) that I would not want to expose my young child to.To purchase the wall charger, it cost us an extra 20, and it cost us 15 to have the ads turned off. So now we're up to 194 for the Kindle Fire that we thought we were getting for 159, plus a whole bunch of time wasted trying to figure out how to turn off the ads, and waiting for the wall charger to arrive.I am normally a HUGE Amazon fan, but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Would have given the device 4-5 stars on its own, but with the extra expenses and hassle, I have to take it down a couple stars.***Update Oct 10, 2012*** Interesting that many folks have taken my review as an opportunity to comment on my parenting skills. While I'm sure folks are well intentioned (sarcasm), I don't recall asking for parenting advice. Many have said it's ridiculous to buy an eReader for a child who can't read.Read more"

Carouselbetty65,5,Great for Mom,I purchased this for my mom for Easter - her eye sight isn't as good as it use to be but she loved to play games on her phone. So this is bigger for her to play her games and for 80 years young she is doing great with it.

GadgetGuy,4,Does what you need,If you just want a tablet that gets the job done. Then here you go.
Adamania1,4,Decent for the price,"I picked up this tablet when it was on sale. It wasn't a tablet meant for primary use and it is not an iPad. But for the price, the tablet is very powerful. With Amazon prime I could do much more than I expected. My complaint is that the front facing camera zooms too much on your face. Also, there is only so much that a single speaker can achieve. But it is definitely worth buying as a backup tablet."
FlyingWeasel,4,Good tablet for my 2 year old,"This is the third fire in our house now and they're all solid, if unspectacular. For $40, the hardware can't be beat, but this newest version of the operating system is very clunky and not intuitive in the least. Once you get over th leading curve though, it's a good way to keep the boy quiet on a plane"
Ashley,4,Good tablet,I like the tablet. We got it for my nephew who is 5. He can easily use it daily. He has a lot of educational games downloaded and it stays charged for awhile.
Loverboy,5,Strong and Durable Tablet,My daughter fell in love with it instantly best ever
LawDawg512,5,Can't beat the value,"You won't find a better tablet for the price. Tried multiple different tablets in the same price range and the amazon fire outperformes them all in every category. If you want a good tablet and on a budget, this is your tablet!"

RetiredAMT,4,My first tablet,"I like the large display, it is very readable for this old man's eyes. The colors are vibrant and crisp. It plays videos well. I love the Amazon Underground absolutely free apps and games. The only drawback for me is the Amazon modified Android OS. I'm slowly figuring it out. The cameras leave a lot to be desired, although they are not the reason I bought this. It is a bit heavy for me, but with a folio it is easier to hold. I also bought the tempered glass screen protector."
Mosh,4,Good tablet for the price,"I am enjoying my Amazon seven inch tablet. It is fast paced with good graphics and long battery life. The main problem is that the volume is lower than other tablets. Still,great deal for the price."

MiMi,4,Good product for a good price,"This is a good product for a good price. Please note my use of the word ""good"". The Amazon Fire tablet is not the best tablet on the market but it is a good deal for a low price. I bought this product as a gift for my mom and she likes it. It gets the job done. She uses it occasionally to read during her morning commute on the train or in a busy waiting room. This is not a product built for heavy use."
AimT,5,Great for traveling,I bought this to download videos to watch while going on a long road trip. It worked perfect for that.
Rafa,5,"Great 7"" Tablet","This tablet give you the opportunity of everything, surf the web, email, music, games, etc."
fc9073,5,Excellent choice for non-tech savvy beginner.,"Bought the Fire for my 86 year old mother. Yes, she's 86 and still works part time at a museum. Her co-workers communicate at times with emails and she was not able to participate. The Fire was the perfect answer for an inexpensive and easy to operate device to keep her in the loop with all the upcoming events. The Fire is easy to operate and wasn't too intimidating like a laptop or desktop. Mom has caught right on and is using it daily. Great choice for a beginner. Very happy it's working for her."
INDYJON,4,GOOD VALUE,LIMITED CAPACITY BUT FOR THE PRICE IT IS A VERY GOOD BUY
BestBuyBlueGirl,3,It's okay for my grandson but not so much for me,"The apps I really want it won't let me download. I don't like that I HAVE to sign up for ""One Click"" with a credit card."

Jbranstetter80,5,"Great tablet, drop in a 32gb card AND",then you have a beast of a tablet. Especially when you can catch these on sale for $39.95
GDMason,5,"I love it, love it, love it.",This is a great tablet especially for the price. The only draw back is that I could not load an app that I needed for work because Kindle does not accept google play apps.
redsdman,5,You gotta get you one,Bought 3 off them all together go get your now works good when shopping online
caskimo,5,Kindle Upgrade,Wanted to get my wife an upgrade to her old Kindle and this was it. Works great and she likes the fact that it is in color.

Justsomeone,3,Good value for the price,I bought this tablet as Bestbuy was closing them out. I find the screen is okay but not iPad quality. The speed is fine for my intended use but I would not be happy if I needed to use as my primary tablet.The operating system is lower then the current android build and I have not found a upgrade path.
Titankiller,5,Great price great product,For the money the best tablet you can buy. I bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with. I love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities.

Kayleigh,5,Love it!,"I got this as an upgrade for my old kindle & I love the new features! Crisp clear picture, easy to find app locations & tabs. Well organized. They added ""blue shade"" to adjust the color of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep. When reading it learns your pace & gives you an estimate on when you will finish the book which I think is neat. Can watch Netflix/Hulu. All around great product in my opinion."
SaiSrivatsav,3,Amazon Fire,Its a beginner tablet. Not so great interface. I prefer larger size tablet
Renae,4,Great for beginner,Bought the new for Father's Day. Works well sometimes have to reset it to connect to Internet. All the apps are easy to access.

Kevin,5,Excellent Tablet,"I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the tablet. I had watched the prices go up and down on Amazon. I wish I had bought one when they were $29.99. I also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews. I had a trip coming up that I didn't want to take my laptop on and took the plunge. I was glad that I did. I was able to watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go (HBO Now) and YouTube with no problems. It is a great tablet for the price. I also have some books loaded to read later. I have been using my Kindle touch for that. If you do buy this tablet I would suggest getting a memory card."
Popkorn,4,Good picture...,I use it for games and movies...its great..good picture quality....great sound...could use more storage space..but i guess thats why they make sd cards...

nhojmcqueen,5,High Value Gift,This tablet was a gift for my nephews and nieces to share (ages 4-8). Their eyes lit up as soon as they tore off the paper and saw the bright orange package. It was easy to set up and they were quickly downloading and installing their favorite games from the Amazon App Store. Screen quality appears to be very good and processing speed is very quick! Our only regret is that we didn't buy the 3-pack so that they each could have their own instead of sharing! Great performance value and much appreciated gift!

JaffrinSetsu,4,"For the price, it can't be beat","I purchased the 7"" and 8"" units at the same time.

chooseanickname,4,Good for what it is supposed to be,"Good for what it is supposed to be- not a high-end iPad for sure, but for the price, can't beat it. Gift for my son, a low risk way to acclimate him to tablets, but not a big loss if he destroys it. Relatively speedy, good resolution, OS takes a LOT of getting used to after iOS... parental controls were a nice addition."

Melvin,4,Great high-quality tablet for the price,I am surprised that they could sell this tablet for so low considering it's quality. It's not the best tablet by a long shot but I haven't had many complaints for the price. The apps and OS run very well; not sluggish like one may think.

This was a spur of the moment but where I wanted something to take on the plane and not spend a lot. And so far it has been my traveling buddy. For the price it is good and does what it should without to many compromises; ( ads) if your not looking for a lot nice stop.
Maurice,4,Good bang for your buck,I got this because it was much cheaper than the iPad and it supports flash. The bonus comes with the ability to binge on my Netflix series and listen to music.

TanyaR,4,Good tablet,"Tablet is a great size to hold and allow children to play games on (such as ABC mouse), and even got Pokemon Go to work on it after some fiddling. Only complaint is how much needs to be on the system storage, even when having a large SD card, so that limits how much you can have."
Kimmyp,4,Great!,I bought this tablet for my almost 3yr old. We didn't want to splurge on an iPad and this was a great price. We love to read books on it and watch movies in the car!
Peepers121,4,Good cheap tablet.,"I bought this tablet with the desire to Root and maybe flash a custom ROM. While you can down grade to a previous version to root with kingroot, you can no longer flash custom roms. Still happy with purchase. This is my 3rd Fire 2015."

GtLounging,3,Good tablet for the price,"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services."

Josh,4,Great cheap tablet,The Amazon fire is a great inexpensive tablet. I only wish that it had a more true version of Android. There are some games and apps that won't work on the fire because of how much Amazon has changed the Android OS.
GrantEE,5,Cheap but not cheap,"I was amazed how little it cost to get a Kindle Fire these days. I passed down my iPad mini to my son because he uses it a lot and I just wanted something to watch Netflix and read books. The big plus is the book lending library with our prime membership. It's noticibly slower than my old iPad, but for $50 I'm very happy with it."
Ezzy,4,Good tablet,"The tablets that I purchased have worked great for their purpose. Only problem I have is a couple glitches I keep running into. It's frozen up twice. I end up having to wait til it dies to restart it. Kinda sucks but other than that, my kids love it and I'm happy."

Char,5,Purchased as a replacement,"All of our kids - ages 4, 7 and 8 - have had their own Kindle Fire for almost two years. They're generally pretty careful with them since they've been told that broken Kindles will not be replaced. In one case, the Kindle simply stopped working - it would no longer turn on. There was a great deal going on so we did replace it. What a perfect product for a child! So many apps are available and they can learn new things while thinking they're just having fun. ;)"

Grownandlovingit75,5,Great inexpensive tablet!,"I bought this for a gift but kept it for my self. It has basic functioanality, but easy to use. This definitely not for those expecting a powerhouse tablet, but for a child it is great!"
Nita28,4,Easy set up.,First kindle. Only used a few things. It was easy to set up. Now to purchase another for my daughter and see how easy to link.
JustinMoody,5,Kindle Fire,This is a good value but I purchased a Kindle Fire Black Friday of 2015 and I have to say it has more features and now I am spoiled. It is a 16 gb storage also. I want another one like it in case mine ever quits.
Wellmomma,5,Great kindle,"Have enjoyed this kindle, especially for the price."
kjenk,4,Great Product,Perfect for my child. Only issue I have with it is the advertisements that pop up when you turn it on.
Elaine,5,Easy breezy Amazon Fire,"Christmas present for a 4 year old. Showed her once how to turn it on, how to charge and how to get to the various apps. She is totally capable of operating the device on her own. So easy breezy a 4 year old can use it independently."

Bunny,3,Not durable at all,I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me. Honestly it got to me because I you can't do anything about it its fine just tell me. But don't male me gp allthe way there and waste my time. Ended up buying a better and bigger tablet. Although my amazon fire still works its screen is all cracked oh well.

skylion,5,Inexpensive tablet,Bought for our son as a first tablet. He loves it and connects easily to our home wireless.
Grumpy,4,Wouldn't give it up.,"The price on this is great. There are a couple of issues I have with my Kindle but I think it's me not the device. Sometimes when I shut it off I have to hold down the power button as the box that comes up that says ok or cancel does not work for me. The other problem I have is sometimes it does not go back to where I left off in a book. I took it to the store and the tech I had look at it did not have these problems. Other that that I love it. I can travel with it instead of my bulky lap top and have access to my email, movies and books. I purchased a case for it that sets it up so I don't have to hold it and that made me like it even more."
JWilliamsBB,4,Good Tablet 4 daughter,A great place to start in tablet market good value
Elflord,5,Easy to use,I love the price of this product. And for the price it gives you Big Bang for the buck. My wife does not use electronics and she has no problem using this.

DXforever,4,pretty good tablet,"Bought this tablet as a gift and so far they are happy with it. I did the set up and I can tell you it didnt lag or freeze so thats always a plus. It runs on the amazon app store. I dont care for it cause it dont have as many apps as others. Other than that and the low memory, I like it. Personally I download alot of game apps so i need lots of memeory but for my mother in law its just fine. She likes to read books on it, she says its good for that. Also she was able to get the libraries app and download free books so thats a plus."
SamGal87,3,Good for the price,Pretty slow if you're trying to use it as a full-time tablet. Good as an eReader and sometimes game and Internet usage.

Cord,5,Great product,Bought for my grandma and she loves it. Very easy and simple to use.
TechTink,5,Get product. Great price.,"I currently own 3 Kindles, including this one, so I am very familiar with the Kindle Fire tablets. I love that this new Fire has updated the look and feel. I can add a memory card to download books, movies, photos and games on so I can take them with me when I'm on the go and don't picture, which I love! So for $50, it's a great value. There are only 2 things that I wish this Kindle had: there is no sleep/wake function and it doesn't have the micro hdmi port to connect it to my TV, but again, for the price it's a great product."
Cindy,4,Great for my kids!,"Just needs more memory, but we can handle that. My boys love them!"
1649,4,Good buy,I am satisfied with the Kindle Fire but would have liked a bigger screen model. Good for playing games.
Sirkswife,4,Great kindle for the price,"Kindle is good. I got one for my husband and sister. They are really enjoying them. It is easy to use for someone who never used one. My reason for not giving 5 stars was completely due to my best buy experience. I live in a small town and drove thirty miles to get to best buy only to find they were completely out. Asked for help at service desk and they seemed put out by me.I wanted them to call another best buy to see if they had any.I was willing to hold them with a credit card in order to get them. They would not do that. I had to drive another 50 miles to pick one up. Just thought best buy should have tried to be more accommodating, but it was Christmas shopping season."
WaxhawBob,4,Nice tablet for the money,"Bought 2 of these on sale for my grandkids. They love them & they seem to work good. One tablet goes to school the other, if it lasts until next school year, will be going to school also. Good tablet for the money."

Hope,5,Always a fabulous deal,The Amazon Fire offers the same access to online resources as the much more expensive IPad and functions just as well.
Rishav,1,Rishav,Bad performance. Slow device. Not worth buying. Better products are available in this range.
JBethea,4,Great for kids,"We bought 2 of these for our kids. First, I couldn't believe the price; they were on sale for $35 but are normally still under $50. I was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. If you have kids, especially younger ones I would highly suggest the Fire. Also, the price is unbeatable, especially the way kids can damage things :)"
Harry,5,Great Gift,Purchased for an 8 year old grand daughter who loves to read. She loves this tablet and is reading and playing her games everywhere the family travels. She loves the device and the pink color; I loved the price and the fast delivery .

Nicole,4,Pretty good for little kiddos,"We got this for my son foe Christmas. Loves it and keeps him entertained! It is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. The only fault I see with this is in kids account. Before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. I wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. I do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so I cant complain too much. Other than those two things my son loves it!"
Sarah,5,Kids love it,I love the kindle. My kids love playing their Disney movies on it. They also have a ton of games we downloaded for free. I highly recommend!
24hoursaday,4,a lot of bang for your buck,"There is a lot of bang for you buck in this product. It is not up to par with Apple pads and the high end Samsung pads. Check out the Amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available. The screen is adequate, not HD, and outside/full sun hard to read. The operating system is Amazon's version of Android. Audio is adequate. WiFi and Bluetooth work well."
BunchFamily,4,Great Tablet for Youth,The tablet is easy to set up and easy to use. Great tablet for family use.
Annette,5,Great price,"My daughter always want one, she got this one, she love it."
Demossa,5,Love it,I was worried at first since it was cheap but I'm loving it more and more everyday. In fact I went out and bought another for a Christmas gift for a family member. Easy gift. And you can use HBO go and Netflix. The only negative is there was no blue tooth. Just a FYI it's the 5th gen 8g amazon fire

Mimi,5,Great for kids,My daughter loves it and you can't beat the warranty!
Juju,3,Good for children,I brought these as christmas presents for my kids and so far no complaints.
CHEFMAN98,4,Wonderful Basic Tablet,"To me, this is an AMAZING little device. I suppose it's not very fast by modern standards. Downloads are heavily dependent on the speed of your internet connection and are slow and often unreliable--my home internet connection is not the greatest. But the screen. for its size, is beautiful. There are many games, apps, and books available for free. I LOVE my Kindle Fire. It has wonderful, lean, fast apps for accessing email and Facebook. The graphic on games amaze me. If you want a basic tablet for not a lot of money, I think this is a great choice. I'm considering getting one for my sister."
hdkinger1959,5,Excellent Tablet,"This Amazon Tablet is, for the money, the best one on the market today. I purchased them for Christmas gifts this year (2016) and when I saw them, Grabbed 2 out of the 5 that were on display. I did so, because last year when I tried to get one, Everybody was sold out !!! Not 1 to be had !!"

Rider0,3,You Get What You Pay For,"Not the best tablet. Decent image, but lackluster performance."
Karen,5,So glad I bought this,"I bought this because of the low price on Black Friday. My aging eyesight was making it difficult to read my original Kindle. And, I have gotten spoiled by my other products with touch screen. Thrilled I bought this because can see to read at night again and touch screen is nice. The light is not too bright, so does not cause headaches for me."

Batman,5,Great tablet,It's good for reading books. It's great for playing games. Yeah.
dldindavenport,2,Not a kindle fan,"I purchased this tablet because it was extremely cheap. I'm not impressed with anything about it. It is slow, not at all user friendly, and the advertising is so very annoying. It is also almost totally useless as it does not support the few apps I use on a regular basis. I will keep it only to access my amazon accounts."
Dawny,5,Great tablet. excellent for someone new to tablets,I bought two and gave them as gifts to a couple new to tablets. They love the FIRE tablet. now I think I am going to get one to play my games on. I currently have the iPad air.

Trulyblessed220417,3,An okay tablet for children,The only bad thing I can say about this tablet is that after using certain apps you have to turn the tablet completely off in order to get to the main screen.
Akko,4,Good,Good tablet for traveling and reading on the road.
Suchit,5,Best tablets for kids,It has a multiple futures for kids and parental control that you can setup for your kids. Even you can control usage of tablet for your kids

sherman,4,Great for kids and affordable!,I bought this for my youngest to read and play. Awesome!
drdave,5,Great tablet for the price,"Wow. I've had many tablets, but none come close to this for the price. The screen is clear and responsive. While it comes locked to amazon, i sideloaded the nook app without root, and then rooted it easily, just for fun. XDA has the details."
Micl,2,OK,"Overall the tablet is okay, I just paid 50$ so can't complain anything about specs but the fact that you can't use google services sucks. No google, no youtube, gmail!"
tjpyka,4,everything we needed,"Had been looking to replace an RCA tablet from a couple years ago for the kids, one that wouldnt break the bank but still was powerful enough for the games the kids would use it for. Sleek, lightweight, powerful, love that it has 2 cameras."

Lewis,5,Great Little Tablet,Great price and product. i bought 2 for my nieces. This is very practical and does the same as the more expensive one's.
Hiker4Lf,4,Good value,"If you want the combination of a kindle for reading as well as some of the features of a tablet, this is an excellent value for the price. I like the flexibility of being able to switch between the book I am reading and my email or other web uses.It seems like the battery discharges rather quickly compared to my other kindle. I often keep this one plugged in while I am using it."
Katde,5,Good buy,I am impressed with the quality of the Amazon Fire for the price

purebredmommy,5,great value,this tablet works great for note taking at school.
Tyler651,5,Great cheap device,Purchased this device for my son and really enjoyed it. Ended up buying another after a day of using the device.Pros:- Fast boot time- Clear & sharp display- Long battery life- Light weightCons:- Adds on lock screen- Inability to remove apps from the home screen (Can only move them to a folder)- Screen shows more fingerprints then say an Ipad or Nexus deviceOverall this has been a great device and hasnt had any issues. I play Game of War on the device and watch Hulu/Netflix for the majority of my use. For an Ebook is it smaller but does the job.
MOMMAOF3,4,Amazon Fire - 7 Tablet good buy for my kids,I purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period. So far so good! It's a perfect fit for my two younger children. And I feel you can't beat the price for a Fire. I have control on what they access. The only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose. When charging I have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit.
Smoke14,5,Excellent buy,A very good tablet with a lot of features for a very reasonable price.

ReverseApacheMaster,3,No what I was hoping for but still a good value,"I came across this on sale and couldn't pass it up. Turns out it runs slower than I expected though. My girlfriend has an older version of this model and it just seems to run smoother than this one. Still, a nice alternative for browsing/shopping/bill paying than wearing about my smartphone battery."
fakefizzle,5,GREAT tablet,"Great tablet thats ready right out of the packaging. It comes pre loaded with loads of apps and has a nice feel in the hands. screen quality is nice, the only thing i would like to see changed is the amount of time it takes the kindle to start up and shut down, it can get annoying at times. i have a 2 yo and 8yo and its held up great, dropped on cement and no cracks."

jenn,5,Great for the Price,excellent value for the price. Tablet works well for my 9 year old!
Irynaklimuk,5,10,Goog!I would recommend this to a friend!!!I like it
bobaplace,5,"cheap price, good product","Please don't let the cheap price of this tablet fool you. I can do a lot with it: surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games, etc. There's an issue with the volume of Amazon Fire 7 (not quite loud enough for me even when I turn the volume to its max). But I think I still did a great decision to buy it. Good product overall."
Jax5,4,Good tablet for basic use,Good tablet for general use. Easy to add apps. Good battery lifetime.
Jussi,5,Fun to Use,"I love my Amazon Fire, it's easy to download books, fun to read and I use it to catch up on my Facebook and email accounts."

Nikki,4,LOVE IT!,I wish it were a little bit bigger but it's just right for what I need. It's light weight and compact. Very easy to use and priced very reasonably!
nina,4,Good Tablet,It works great for what I need. Not a fan of ads and that it sends e-mails of all the apps I download. But I just use it for a few apps.
Richard,4,Kindle Fire Hits the Sweet Spot Again,"I am pleasantly surprised with Amazon's new 5th Generation Kindle Fire.As a purchaser of a 1st Generation Kindle Fire, I welcomed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microSD slot. This version of the Fire is lighter in the hand and seems to hold up well to my handling of the device.The new OS seems to work well in spite of the ""commercial"" aspect. After finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ads, my Fire became more enjoyable. This feature was not a surprise but what I would expect in a device from Amazon and its ecosystem.The Kindle Fire is an excellent 7-inch tablet for its $50 price and the perfect entry in the arena of small tablets for the newby."
Dngrmonkey,4,Good buy for kids,Bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that was on recall. The Amazon ecosystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well. I like the options for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goals are met FIRST. Unit needs more on board memory however. Make sure to buy an sd card to expand.
Kime,3,Great tablet for a beginner,Great tablet for a beginner to catch up on reading.
Alucard76,4,Great for my 9 yrs old son,great price and great birthday gift for my son.no complaints so far. my son & his sister enjoy playing games and watching videos.

Mark,5,great for all ages,we bought this for my 11 year old daughter and we love it. So easy to set up and use. Much better than the one made especially for kids. This one has better capabilities.
KeithM,4,For the kids...,I've purchased Kindle Fire in the past for our girls and they loved them (literally) to pieces. They lasted 2 years before cracked screens meant replacement was necessary. These new kindles at such a great price point meant a no hassle replacement was easy! They work great and the girls are happy.
hopshead1,5,What a deal!,"I had to buy this Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black, as the price was right.What a great device. I did not expect it to perform the way it has. I have streamed video, read books and installed a 64GB sdcard i had laying around. Great for travel, due to the price I really have not lost anything if it is lost or damaged."
zigger74,5,Perfect gifts!,"Giving these out as gifts this holiday season and couldn't be happier!! Great price point, perfect size and easy to enjoy for anyone in the family!"
Dave,5,Shock value,"This Amazon Fire tablet is AMAZING. It's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. You get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. The screen is surprisingly well made and durable. While it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. There is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. The speaker gets to a decent volume, but I would not consider it to be loud. I took a leap of faith here in buying this and I am so very glad that I did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. The games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what I've seen so far. This plays demanding 3d games pretty well I may add. The Amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. It only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. The micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. Battery life is ok. If not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. With light use, this could last all day on a single charge. Video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. The responsiveness of the screen is spot on. I can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. The one thing I will say could be better it the wifi. When set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. Once I set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. You usually get what you pay for. In this case, you get more. This unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. I'm just sad that I didn't yet get a protective case for mine. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. This Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. I'm picky too. If you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. You won't be disappointed."
Andres,5,Excellent!!!,"Great features and for an excellent price. I bougth it for my son, 6 yrs old. It allows me to control what features he can use, Apps, books, videos, etc. He used an Android one (my wife's) before, and with this he still has access to all the apps he regularly used."
codAW,5,tablet,For having a discount for this price it was a deal i couldn't pass up. Even when everywhere seems to be sold out of this item i was still able to find best buy mobile had them in stock. Makes a great stocking stuff.

Boffin,5,"I am not an Android fan, but....","For $50 this table was a no brainer. It's fantastic. Light, good battery life and I get the apps that I want/need.I am not a fan of the Silk browser, but I didn't buy this to surf. I bought it to read books and watch Netflix. It works perfectly for that. It's so good, I bought 2."
Wolfstar11,5,Best Tablet you can get for 50$,I have dabbled in the market for a inexpensive tablet for a while and found this and boy am I glad I did. Tablet runs faster than I thought and has a very good display. If you can't afford an Ipad get this!
drummerJ99,5,Good little tablet,"First I must say out of the box I'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1)No Google Play store (which means no Google apps) and stuck with Amazon App Store.2)Have to pay $15 to remove ad filled lockscreenHowever I rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which A)installs Google Play services and B)removes the ad lockscreen. The tablet is now easily 5 stars. I wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. This does those things great. I've also tested a few videos form a few sites like Prime Video & YouTube and it works great. Sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what I want.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install Google Play Store. If you want to keep it as is out of the box, I'd recommend staying away from Amazon and going a full fledged Andriod tablet like Samsung."
Ontario,4,great for a young child,The tablet has good versatility and is an excellent device for young children.
zerofighterblue,5,cant live without,have a kindle with a broken screen. bought originally for 99.00. now regular price is 49.99 and were on sale black Friday for 34.99. got 2 more.

Chucker,5,Can't beat the price,"Bought this during the black friday sale for $35 and can't complain at all. Keeps my kids busy, and runs hearthstone, that's all I need."
missbethany67,3,Limited Fun,"We are pretty unhappy with this purchase. Several of the most popular apps (Instagram, You Tube, etc.) are NOT compatible with this device. Now I know why the sale on this was so great. We can really only run the internet and Facebook on this device. Will be returning and getting a different tablet."
rattlerchick,5,Great for reading books and checking emails,"This is the third one in our house. It's great for book reading, surfing the web and checking emails"
southernbelle87,4,Gifts,I bought two of these as gifts for Christmas. One for my mom and one for a 9 yr. old. I'm a tech geek so I think these are great to introduce to and older parent or small kid just because of the price alone (Not for us tech guru's). I got them on black Friday for $34.99. Great e reader and awesome for games like candy crush. Only downside is the 8gb but for $34.99 that's not even an issue!
Carlton,5,Lovely product,My wife loves it she uses it every night to read her romance novels so if my wife's happy I'm happy!!!
Benjamin101,5,great budget tablet,So having this Amazon tablet for about a month or so it has its pros & cons let's be clear you aren't getting an iPad with amazing specs but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kids or for regular things like browsing the web & emails. the camera on here isn't really the best you're better off using a potatoe ha it's similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day. Watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when I tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly I think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around & great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing I really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 500-1000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down (:
Herbie,5,I love my Kendal fire,"For the price that I paid for this tablet, ut is a great deal. It does exactly what i bought ir for"
Cowboykev,4,Good for price,Good product great price.best buy rep was good help

Amy80,5,great for kid apps,"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. I set it up and then wrapped it so its ready to play as soon as it is unwrapped. Free apps are good, some l get on my android are not available here. School websites dont work. Wish I had waited for black friday price but am overall happy with purchase."
TheBestGuyatBestBuy,5,Best 50 Bucks I have spent this Holiday Season,"What can I say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. I did buy it during Black Friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50(regular price). It may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. I have been able to watch Netflix and play games on it with no problem. Plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. This is going to be my travel tablet and I did buy a second one for my cousin for Christmas. I think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made."
Dadof3,4,Nice,Bought this tablet for my daughter so far so good!

Heyou,4,kindle Fire,I love that I can have the convenience of my laptop and my games in a small tablet.
modernlady2,5,Great tablet. Great size,The weight and inches of the tablet is convenient for traveling
Photo136,4,Good product for simple occasional use,"Bought this as part of the Black Friday sale. For $40, it serves well as a light use tablet (Skype, e-mail, video, etc.). The ads and heavy Amazon product front load push are annoying. Can't change or hide any preloaded features. Can't complain much for the price and the fact that I won't break a sweat if it falls out my car or gets misplaced."
Raay,1,Screen cracked on 1st drop,"I bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. Also bought a screen shield & a 'kid proof' case. However, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it. At least it was only $50 :/My nephew has an 1st gen iPad Air, w a kid case; he's dropped it many times, the screen is fine. You get what you pay for."
katydid,5,Excellent reading tool for kids,The Whispersync technology that allows a child to read a book and listen to the audio book while it highlights the words is an indispensable tool for young readers.
rdwallace,4,"excellent device, works well, enjoying","I have really enjoyed this device. It works very well. Only thing I was disappointed with was that when I bought it the cashier at Best Buy said if I found it cheaper in another store, or online that would give me the difference in the money. I did find it cheaper online but the manager refused to give me the difference of $15. I suggested they not tell customers they would honor a cheaper price when they won't really do it."
Deadeye,5,Surprised,"Bought this as a gift as I was on a budget, I figured it would be okay but I got say it is actually faster than my iPad Air with connectivity and more than abundant features and apps"
tfsports,5,Great tablet for the price,"If you want a tablet to perform basic functions, you can't do any better than the Kindle Fire 7. Check email, social media, surf the web, download and read ebooks with no problems. Good battery life."
kids5,5,Love this,I got this as gifts for my kids and other family then even myself. I wish I would have got this tablet along time ago.
Court,4,Good product,"Overall this seems to be a good tablet, but I wish it used the Google Play store as well as the Amazon apps, because I can't get the Target Cartwheel without paying."

Fauxpas,5,Better than I expected,I use this mostly as an e-reader but it is also great for web browsing and e-mail. I didn' t expect such good performance for the price but I have no complaints.
David,5,This product works great for my 3 young boys,"I bought three of these tablets. One for each of my boys. They are 5, 6, and seven years old and I have to tell Them to put these down. They would play with them all day if they could"
Hyvo,5,Fun,We bought these a Christmas for our 3 children they have been a great present the kids really enjoy them
Fire,5,$$$Value,"For the low cost what's not to like. Be careful what/how much you load into the limited memory. An excellent entertainment tool especially when powered with PRIME. Screen (movies & Tv) display excellent. I recommend a ""glass"" screen protector. Helps greatly manage finger smudge. EZ to setup. EZ to use. EZ on your wallet."

Fernie,5,Hands down amazing tab for price!!,Have now had for a month and I have to say the speed of this tablet is good. Really no lag on browsing. Only major downfall that some games might lag a bit. But for the most part it will do pretty much any other tablet double or even triple its price will do.
npowell0214,5,Awesome for around the house,We have two laptops and smart phones but love having the tablet to use instead of our phones
disneyismagic,4,Good Tablet For The Price,"I Purchased Three Of These For Family Members As Christmas Gifts On Black Friday For Only $34.99 each!!Pros ; Price Is Great, Responds Well To Touch and Running Applications, Small, Portable, Again The Price Is The Best Pro To This Tablet.Cons : Main Homepage Runs Ads In The Background?? Why?? , Apps Are Only Available Through The Amazon App Store Making A Very Limited Selection Compared To Google Play and The App Store For Apple But Again This Equal To The Tax I Paid On My iPad Air."
Jhill,4,good for kids,kids love it...only issue that bothered me is that my reduced price came with ads that in order to be removed i had to pay money. other than that good product

Dolly,4,"Nice little tablet, but a manual would be helpful.","Gave this as a gift to my husband. He likes it very much, but wishes it came with a separate manual of written instructions for using the different functions. He's not a fan of searching for instructions on a device he's not familiar with in the first place. That's frustrating."
Cdub,4,Nice tablet for my son,Perfect little tablet for my son for Christmas. The price makes it a steal for a tablet these days. In addition it meets the requirements a 7 year old has for media needs. He's able to read his homework on it nightly plus take pictures of which he's addicted to lately!
davhut21,4,Great tablet for prime users,The Kindle Fire is great for those that are looking for a tablet to use with WiFi and is even better for those that have Amazon Prime. Makes watching your favorite shows and listening to music very easy. Magazines look great as well.

Danny,4,Really good tablet for very little money,"I was looking for something inexpensive but with a large enough screen that I could use it to read musical charts off of when I perform and this little tablet has been a great solution for me. The screen is sharp and bright, the wifi picks up fairly weak signal and makes good use of what's available, the file hierarchy is fairly simple to navigate. It seems built fairly well and for 39$, I'm happy."
ynnaoreas,5,Amazon fire,"My nephew liked it and uses it, might not be an ipad but it works"
TeeMarks,5,Good for any age,"Bought this tablet for my 4 year old and also one for my father. Both are able to use this for their own purposes and are very happy. Price is good, especially since kids tend to be a bit rough with electronics. Plus for profile creation and restricting access to features from kids."
mujeralegre,5,Used one like it for a raffle prize,easy to use. looks good. The prize winner was very pleased.
deltaiq,5,Great tablet for a great price,"I am amazed with this tablet. For the price I expected something cheaply made to last a short while. I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues). We recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watch/play. Overall, a great product for a really great price!!"
JusandLa,5,Great Tablet for children,This tablet is a good started tablet for children.
InlandBBoy67,5,Gift Tablet,Very simple setup and a great little item for the price.
Momof2,5,Great solution for multiple needs,"I think this is a great product/ solution, especially for the price. I needed to replace my portable DVD player. I have 2 young kids and still wanted something to play movies on the planes and during car trips. After looking at my options I decided on getting them both a Kindle for about the same price of 1 DVD player. HEADS UP: The Disney Anywhere app takes some work to download the movies on the kindle but there is a way. You have to access it through Amazon movies in order to download them. I got a MicroSD card to store the movies on and so far so good! They held up, supplied games, movies and when there is Wi-Fi they can play ABCMouse to get some learning in there too. Great buy. Good luck getting those movies downloaded :)"
Tori,5,Sale,"Got it during black Friday weekend at a great price, works good no problems with them."

Xx6kev6xx,4,"Great for child, okay for adult.","I had been searching for a reliable and durable tablet for my child, after various reviews I went through with purchasing a pair of the kindle fires. For my child it is perfect, he's able to play games and videos without much issues. Being a young child durability is required as was low cost, this item has more than met expectations. For an adult it is more a passable option as the os can be frustrating and the unit will lag on occasion."
Russellohh,5,The best tablet for twice its price,"I'm an android developer, and as such have owned and operated maybe 20 android devices and 10 iOS devices in the last five years. Honestly, the Fire is a bit faster and more stable than many tablets 2-3x its price. I find the UI a bit cluttered- it takes a fair amount of swiping to get where I want, and the home screens stretch on a bit with the default arrangement- but its a wonderful way to read books, check the internet, and do general web browsing. And since its a major name brand tablet , its very easy to find screen protectors and cases at even five below, which fit it perfectly. Too many cheap tablets are such a small, specialized item that you'll never be able to find replacement parts or matching cases. Overall, one of my three favorite devices out of 30 or so."
Tomcat,5,Yes,I recommend this product and Best Buy to friends and family members
Karla,5,Good product for the price,"Very inexpensive, good size and weight to carry, added a 64 gb memory card and I have everything I need, from books to videos."

Frank,2,Buyer beware prime is everything,"So I've been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review's about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really don't know what your experience will be unless you try so I got it and began the prime ""free trial "" I was shocked to wake up this morning to find out I had been charged $107.00 for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with Amazon. the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the Alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync's to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues I think the tablet is OK but no great but because of my recent experience I rated it it 2 stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision"

thebobman,5,What's Not to Like?,"Come on-- I bought a brand new Amazon Fire for $39! I can download and read my books. I can browse the internet. I can probably do other things if I ever get around to that! It's not a PC. It's not a gamer machine. But what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay. If you're actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty bucks for this Kindle you should probably ask yourself-- what do I EXPECT to get for this price? One steak dinner, 3/4 of a tank of gas, a case of brews... or something that's going to last for several years and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading! You really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like I did. Have I convinced you yet? Or are you expecting Amazon to come to your door and hand you a new Kindle for free?!!!"
Chef,4,Satisfied with the price,"Good tablet wish I could download apps on it like on my phone such as bank info, n other app I use would b more beneficial for kids"

ldyluk2003,4,good gift,This was a gift therefore I cannot have a very good review of the item.
NDBounce,4,Nice tablet for the money,"For the price this tablet is not bad (it was a $35 black Friday purchase). It does Amazon prime, netflix, surfs, etc. It is not a truly ""open"" android system, as it's locked down in some ways by Amazon (i.e. you cannot easily access the google play store). Some apps do not run on this tablet (presumably due to system specs). I think I had trouble getting Disney Channel app for this tablet, which is a shame.But for $35, it's hard to expect too much."
BABYBLUE13,5,Love my Kindles!,"This is the 3rd Kindle Fire I have bought. This one was a present for my nephew. I love the Fire tablets, the graphics and picture quality is great. Amazon offers many of the same high quality apps as Apple. I actually have an iPad too but would rather play on my Fire tablet. I have used my Fire tablets in classes, read magazines and books, and watch TV shows and movies for free as I have Amazon Prime."

Megan,4,Great for a kid tablet without the added price tag,"This tablet is a great deal! Simple to use, my son loves having access to all his favorite shows and games without having to ask to use my phone."
thunder7,5,Good tablet,This is a nice tablet with quality that I would expect from a higher priced unit.

ducky12432,5,great tablet for non techie relative,we got this for my dads girlfriend this year for christmas and she was able to just start using it right away. it is a bit akward to hold since it is so long but its not too bad. compared to my tab s2 it is pretty close when it comes to responsiveness. if you want something that is very easy to use and you dont mind the amazon marketplace constantly trying to insert ads and sell you things this is an awesome tablet that can actually have some of that stripped out if you know what to do and how to do it.
SillySally,5,Great for price,"I got it for my 11 year old and she loves it. She can get email, help her with homework etc. The only downside is we can't figure out how to get Google apps."
jlieber603,5,super fire tablet,"I bought 2, 1 for my wife to replace her older tablet and 1 for my grandson, who is 8 yrs old. They both love their fire. My wife has told me it is fast and easy to operate while my grandson takes it everywhere and plays games on it."

prathibha,3,Good,"Got ir in a deal for black friday, worth the money paid!"
aabeene,3,An OK Tablet,Somewhat substandard. iPads are certainly better. But it gets the job done for $50.
Chana,4,Amazon Fire-7 tablet,"I bought the table as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old. Perfect for children or beginners. Decent speed, only complaint is the camera (very bad quality camera)"
junior,5,kids love it,We bought it for our kids and they love it its really easy for them to use it
Shae,1,Horrible,"I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it."
Vegasbaby,4,Christmas Gift,We purchased this for mu husbands mother and she seems to really be enjoying it and it seems user friendly for her

Ajdoom,5,Easy cheap tablet but not cheap material,Easy my kids love it....easy set up ....easy to use
ChurchChoirFan,4,Great Compact Tablet!,"It took me a bit to warm up to it, going from a 10"" tablet to this little 7"", but it is rapidly becoming my go to. The video quality is great, and the audio is more than adequate for a small tablet. I love the convenience of having a smaller tablet - my only wish is that the battery life was a bit longer than the 7 hours. That said - in sleep mode it lasts days. Very happy, and will be purchasing a larger Fire tablet in the future."
Swileosis,5,Great of kids,"I bought this for my kids aged 7 and 3. It's strong, bright, light weight, affordable and easy to use. I have never used any of the Amazon Fire products so there was a learning curve but and hour later I feel like a Fire pro."
Wisco1,4,Nice tablet,"This was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it.

bobby1,4,Like it for 6 year old son,The fire is good had to buy a extra memory card. The charger is shorter than it should be. My son likes it
Tbrooks,4,Great tablet,Tablet is working good. I brought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. It features a freetime app for kids only that way they cant download and surf the browser. My only complaint is that when u turn the tab off and log into the kid profile it has to download all the apps again.
leash,5,Great tablet,"My son loves this. We've had two other tablets, both cost about the same as this. The others were pretty unusable. This table is fantastic, definitely great value for the money."
NursingAngel723,3,Good starter tab for a small child,"Very hard to set up child profile without paying for a subscription to freetime. Once I got it finally set up though, runs smoothly, but battery doesn't seem to last very long."
WendyLady,5,Great product! Great value!,"I decided to buy my son a tablet. After lots of research, this turned out to be the best one for it's price point. It even has expandable memory! So if you want a simple go to tablet I highly recommend this one!"

Wordzero,5,Best tablet for the price.,Got this for $35 on Black Friday. Even if I paid full price I'd be more than happy with it. Nice and portable and does everything you'll need.

Leigh,5,Good tablet for money,A fast and good quality tablet for the money that you spend.
OscarM,4,Good Bang for the Buck,"Purchased two of these tablets for Christmas presents (10 yr old and 7 yr old children). Had researched them prior to buying so new what they were capable of and what they weren't. Pleasantly surprised with overall performance and durability. No, they are not iPads, didn't expect them to be, but at a sixth of the cost they do their job extremely well."
Dtweeter,5,Great Price for the Amazon - Fire - 7,"I bought this for my son, He really loves it for reading and playing Games."

jdavis1735,5,Fantastic for Price,"This is for our 2 year old. Yes, she is 2 and yes she knows how to use these. This tablet is perfect for simple use, children, reading, etc. I wouldn't want to boggle it down with hundreds of apps, but this does it's job and was a great deal at that price!"
mmikecamel,5,Great value at $35,Bought as holiday gifts for older kids. They loved them. I helped set up and you can tell the quality of the product by the way it feels in your hands. Very quick processing. Suggest buying micro sd cards for additional storage space. 8GB isn't much.
TKB6112,5,Great little tablet for the grandkids,Bought as presents for the grand-kids. Perfect size for them...perfect price for us. Win Win
Dave,5,This made a great christmas present! What is WiFi,"This was a great christmas gift, for the person that I bought it for. They asked Santa for it, and it looks like he came through again this year.

Dejzekzue,4,great tablet for beginner,"It is a great product for the price, does need the expansion card for memory!!!"
DonZiAq,4,For What Itz Worth - It Does The Job,"System over-all is fast and I mean for less that $50, its very reliable.The only downside, its uses almost 50% of the internal storage already, OS and built-in apps ... Should have settled for 32GB or more.Other than that, this toy is just ok :)"
RobBrom,4,You DO get what you pay for!,"I like it allot, but the memory size is somewhat limiting. I thought that I could save and run apps from the SD card, but it seems that most of the app still need to reside in the internal memory.Also beware that Android apps will not work on a Kindle. Kindle Fire apps need to be downloaded from Amazon."
shelly,5,easy to use,great product used by all ages and everyone love it
Colleen,3,Great for needs,Like the fact that you can add extra memory to this tablet. Overall great for travel for books and videos on Amazon.

sunshine,3,A beginners tablet,We bought this tablet for my 75 year old father who wanted something handheld to play games and read his email. It is good for that.

TMFoor,5,Great Budget Tablet,This is a great entry point into the tablet market. This was a purchase for my father in law and he really enjoys it. It is a bit on the smaller side but he wasn't sure if he would want a tablet. So far he really seems to be enjoying it.
achampa2,1,Disappointed,"can not down load any apps from goggle play, didn't know amazon and goggle don't have agreements to sharge"

Appman2015,4,Great for xmas,So far I have bought three of these of tablets and they love it
bar314,5,excellent tablet for the money,the only bad thing I could come up with would be the battery doesn't last that long. otherwise this tablet is great for the money does everything an apple does and can add to the memory witch is fantastic.
lmtu,5,"Excellent 7"" Tablet","This is a gift to my daughter, she likes to play games and web browsing with it, and she is very happy with this tablet."
mcjames37,5,Nice tablet at a great discount.,"Got this tablet on Black Friday. I love how easy it was to get this tablet up and going. Now I don't have to use my phone to get on the internet. If you are looking for an affordable tablet, this is the one for you."
Ferrari5000,4,Wonderful gift,Bought two of them during the Thanksgiving sale for $35 each. I mainly bought them for gifting purpose but used one of them myself and was not disappointed. You get what you pay for but for $35 this is the best gift that someone is going to receive.
MSRS,3,Good for Kid's basic use,The Tablet is good for Kid's Basic use to watch Videos and play few games. Touch should be improved.

Karlo,5,"55"" HD Samsung Curved Flat Screen T V w/sound sys",We are enjoying our TV with the surround system. The picture is great as you can see detail's in people and back ground we didn't notices before. We need to get a new dish receiver to move the TV to its new location were we will be wireless.
mrnice,4,4stars for the price,"i bought two of these to gift, but i kind of want to keep them for myself."

Adam,2,OK at the Black Friday Pricepoint,I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. My problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. Just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to Amazon Fire. This is not representative of the experience of owning one.
kinglowe78,4,Good Deal,Real good deal. Nice present for those who want a tablet
jamal,3,good basic,Good gift for basic Internet use browsing emails .
Abc1,4,Lots of apps to play with,This is a good beginning tablet. Works well and has lots of preloaded apps to start you off.

Steve,5,Awesome,I got this for my 2 year old nephew he loves it and it is pretty quick the one down side is that Amazon charges you $15 if you want to remove the adds that are in the lock screen but besides that the device is perfect for him to play games and watch movies
greatnesstechnology,5,great tab for price,"Great and clear looking screen, with a 3d effect. Easy set up. Loving it!!"

flt23cd2,4,Great for 7 yr old,"Bought this for our 7 year old son for Christmas. Took it on a 1,000 Mile drive and it was great for watching movies and playing games. Only complaint we have is he was unable to download Madden Mobile on it. Not sure if it's the operating system or something else. Great size and would highly recommend as a cost effective tablet."
jeff,5,Cant Beat It For The Price,"Bought them as gifts for my nephews, who are teenagers, and they love them. Obviously you cannot expect them to be as high quality as the $400-500 tablets, but for $35 on black Friday they will serve their purpose."
Becki,5,Great video quality.,Good battery life. I don't have any problems connecting to Wi-Fi.

B1949,5,Perfect size and easy to use,"I am not highly technical and this was easy to learn how to use. It is small enough to be easy to carry. I have been able to download the few games that I play. So far, I can't find a single thing to be unhappy about!"
Mantis,4,Amazon Fire,"It is an excellent tablet, however it's app store is not as good as android."
Jayy,5,Just Right,Purchased this as a christmas gift for my mom who isn't to tech davy. She loved it and says its easy to navigate.
MrMopar15,4,Good tablet for the money,"I purchased 3 of these on the BLACK FRIDAY sale ($34.99 each) and received them in 2 days! Had to wait until Christmas to have them opened by my kids to see their potential. Great tablet and features (especially kid mode) but have only one complaint so far.....one of the tablets had a BAD DIGITIZER right from the start and had a horrible time trying to use the tablet. Hence only giving this item a 4 star rating as this issue should NEVER happen right out of the package. However Bestbuy is doing everything to make sure I'm a happy customer by ""price matching"" when the item is available (completely sold out everywhere). Other than that issue this tablet is user friendly, fast processing/web browsing, decent battery life and great WiFi connection (doesn't drop signal like other tablets). Would recommend!"
Tims54913,5,Great tablet,If your connected to amazon the tablet is great to use.
Only1P,5,Great Tablet,The tablet was cheap and a great deal. The kids love it. It is very nice because it has a kids mode and a separate parent mode.

Ruben,5,great camera for a beginner,For an android powered device and no google support it works alright
Tgr81dk,5,You don't need to spend a lot,"This little tablet is just what I needed. Easy to use and functional with a good display. For cloud access, reading email, internet, using apps, music and photo storage what more can you ask for. Expandable memory this really has nearly everything you could want on an inexpensive device. Don't worry ads don't get in the way they are only one the first screen."
jonnde,4,Bought as gift,This was a gift for my daughter. It's easy to use and can do a lot
Meechie,5,Also got these for Christmas.,Bought for kids like how sturdy they are my son has dropped his twice and it must keeps on going. Also. Added Amazon prime which is a great deal.
jc1028,5,Excellent reader,Bought thd Fird for my daughter and she uses it primarily as an e-book reader.
Jameson1,4,Very satisfied.,I'm so happy with my purchase. I use it mostly as a Kindle. It's a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading. Proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue. It performs better than I expected for a $49 tablet . My wife returned her $800 iPad Pro after a week of comparing the two devices. Only 4 stars because of the weight and the home screen advertisements. Both are minor issues.
Jimmy,4,Good budget Tablet,"A no frills budget tablet. Although it can do some light gaming, I would not recommend it for that, Its best at watching video, browsing the web and reading,"
pharmguy,5,Cheap tablet,A cheap tablet that is a very good bang for your buck.
PrinceAiman,5,"Good tablet for the price, very nice.",Great tablet especially for the price.Brother loved it for Christmas.
TXJoe,5,Great Deal for the Price,"Bought it for my 16yr old for Christmas and she loved it...uses it to surf the internet and social media. Also uses it for movies and music. Great deal for the price, would recommend."
jetster,1,"beware the ""incorrect time"" problem ...going back","purchased it tonight, time is wrong, you cannot change time manually because it has to have wifi to update the time.....AND IT WON'T CONNECT TO ANY WIFI THAT NEEDS A PASSCODE OR PASSWORD BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE CORRECT TIME!!!!!!! THIS IS 2016 TECHNOLOGY AMAZON? I've had many devices, but none that make you find a WIFI without a password (hard to do because starbucks, hotels, etc. all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi...) all because the time cannot be changed without wifi!!!Returning it tomorrow!!!!!P.S. ALSO AN ISSUE ON THE AMAZON FORUMS, SO I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE DEALING WITH THIS!"
CurlyMicheal,4,A nice beginners tablet...,"I got this tablet for my mom as an additional after X-mas gift. She likes the clean/simple/no fuss/etc. way a tablet works, ie, no keyboard/mouse/etc., just your fingers for input."
cnnterr,5,I love this item,Great item for a fraction of the price of an ipdad
Justin,5,Purchased for 8 year old,"Purchased for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas, I don't think she's put it down ever since. I also downloaded Skype (to replace facetime) so that she can speak to relatives through video."
Tip016,5,Great buy,"This tablet was a great buy. The price was lovely, so I purchased three of them for my nephews for Christmas! They love them! They've been very functional for what they are being used for. I have no complaints and they don't either!"
Feed,5,Great Tablet for the money,Good deal. I recommended this tablet to several family members.
LiKuidFox,5,"Simple, Solid Tablet","I picked this up during Black Friday and managed to get it cheaper than MSRP. My girlfriend and I have it in the living room to pick up and use whenever another screen is occupied by something else. It's very useful, and since we weren't looking for anything with deep features, it was well worth the price."
bbyreviewerariana,5,Great for simple use (not games/apps),"I bought this for myself on Black Friday and am very pleased. For a FIFTY DOLLAR tablet, it has a great display and battery life. It's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. That's fine for my needs as apps/games aren't my focus. If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it. If you want to protect the screen, I would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.My point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet."
Lori,4,Really enjoy this for reading books.,Great to use and I like the larger screen. It is fast and easy to use.
Yvette,2,Product wasnt good,The tablet stop working after the second week. I couldnt find the receipt to return it. Its just beenCollecting dust
Tsehaye,5,Great product.,Amazon did a fantastic job. I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift and he loves it.
skl5555,5,Great Table for a beginner,"You give an amazing 7” tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a nice interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I can’t imagine not buying these for your kids, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means.I f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value."
DOTMAN,4,Good for the price.,"This tablet works really well, but the pictures, etc. appear a little small but overall this is a good table. It does what I need and I got it at a great price!"
Jklynhyde,5,"Perfect for my granddaughter, age 13",It is perfect for anyone and especially for a child moving on from a Kurio. It is easily regulated by a parent with the parental controls.
brittanys,4,Great for price,You get what you pay for. The camera is terrible but I bought it for games and reading. The ads can get annoying but for what I paid for its a good product
Jerry,5,Good table for kids,"It's fast ,well build would recommend for anyone who has young kids"
otech,3,First Kindle Tablet,"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet."
topcat,5,Kids love it,The screen is clear and great for playing games and watching videos.Doing homework is easier
fcatsf,5,Great for price,"Not the fastest for loading web pages, but apps run smoothly. I've noticed that internet connection will not function if there is not enough room in memory, so delete some apps if you cannot access wi-fi. Great for Netflix, Flixter and games. Good resolution, just short of HD, but can tell the difference if HD is chosen over SD when given the choice while watching movies."
Fetz,3,Still not a fan of the charging port,"I like the Kindle fire over all, but the Kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. We have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. As a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. We still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. Hopefully one day they will design a better charging port"
Neici5,5,Great Tablet,I bought the fire for my grandson and he loves it.
Devlin,4,Great product and service,"It is exactly what we wanted. Great product we love it Great service, quick and gave us exactly what we wanted."

Snoop,5,Sale price is unbelievable,"Picked one of these Fire tablets up today for the crazy price of $39.99. I didn't really need it, but the extra $10. of was just too tempting. Charged it up, connected to WiFi and all was good to go. Played around with it for a couple of hours and it worked perfectly. Video and sound were good, speed was nice, and I am really impressed with the price. My wife's Kindle paperwhite case cost as much as this full feature tablet. Time will tell about longevity, but first impression is, this is a great little tablet.."
Shrek,5,Amazon Tablet,I bought this tablet for my wife and she loves it!
firstname,4,Nice tablet for the price,This is a fine tablet for $49. A bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for $49 it isn't bad.
pete2b91,5,Nicely made,"It's great for doing anything on Amazon. However you cannot use Google cards to purchase anything with. They're great for reading books surfing the net games, are abundance and the processor is fast so you really don't have a lag"

Benbuc1,4,Nice tablet for the money,I bought this tablet as a secondary one and I'm happy with the ease of use and fairly quick internet usage. You can't beat the price for what it gives you and it's also feels sturdy when holding it.
friendship,5,Good device for the price.,My granddaughter really loves it. She was so anxious to start using it.
33AndMy1STTab,1,Poorqualty,"I purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet. I was so wrong. I couldn't even get it set up for him to use it. Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi. I even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. Maybe it was defaulty equipment. I sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. My other son sat right beside him had perfect Wifi."

LuckyLadybug,5,Great tablet for a beginner,"I would recommend this tablet to everyone that wants a tablet. It is real easy to play games, Facebook and google."
Beninkc,1,5 star device crippled by amazon,This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.
slpydpy6,5,Love,"Love my tablet, it is now my best of best friend!!!"

cowboyjohn,4,Great value,"I got this on black friday for unbelievable price of $32.

If you want a decent tablet , that you don't expect too much from then this is it."
lawyerman,5,Great Tablet!,This is a great tablet for the price. It comes with amazon app store and has plenty of apps and selections. Don't miss this deal!
Rwil9946,2,"Good Price, Had Issues","The price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. I performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. Heard it was a common problem with these. Won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models I would look at those."
kevint,4,Amazon Fire,The Amazon Fire 7 inch turned out to be a good deal. The screen resolution is better than I thought. The battery is very good.
skullcoastboss,4,The fire is on FIRE,It's like having the world in the palm of your hand it really is .it does everything you need it to do AND fits in your pockets AND when you hold it the balance is so perfect it's like holding a baby. I highly recommend for the times when your lap top is just too much

Movadogirl,5,Great for tablet for beginner,I got this for my niece. She loves it! I am happy she is enjoying it!
RLB67,5,Nice starter tablet,Purchased 6 of these tables for Christmas presents and was extremely surprised with how well they work for the price. The Amazon environment takes a little getting used to but the functionality of the tablet is great for the price.
easyg,5,Kindle Fire,Bought this one as a Christmas gift. Employee was very excited to receive and still loves the tablet.
PRSolano,4,Pretty Great!,I purchased this as a gift for a child. After I read tons of reviews and asked my nephew how he liked his... It was GREAT for the price i just wish amazon would allow you to sync your google play.Other than that great product and great experience at best buy :)
Bmoeller27,5,Great Kindle,"This is a great kindle for the price. Smaller travel size with enough power for general use. Does seem slower than other tablets but for a backup or travel companion, you can't beat it."
Electroexpert,4,Not bad for the price but don't expect quality...,One has to keep the price of this in mind. For just $40 you do indeed get a lot. It performs fairly well too for the most part. I didn't notice any lags or anything but the resolution isn't very high/good and it's not the best display if you plan on doing lots of reading. It's just fine for videos though.. The tablet has an overall cheap feel to it but then again have to keep the low price in mind.
glenmon,4,good for reading books,Great price only not enough memory I bought an extra memory card and my wife was very pleased. It was a very good birthday present!
Tyty,4,Great for my 9 year old,Perfect size and features for my 9 year old daughter..fire is made well..she loves it to read and to play games on

Kaykay,5,Great tablet for mobility,"I heard about the Kindle from a friend . So when the BB clerk told me about the Kindle Fire, I decided to buy one. I am very happy that I did. Now whenever something comes up on TV that I don't understand, my Kindle Fire finds the info very quickly."
HenWash,4,Ease Of Use,"It's actually pretty nice. I bought 2 of them for the kids to keep them quiet around the house or while driving in the car. They've downloaded all sorts of games, and watch movies when they have Wi-FI. Getting started at the beginning was a little tricky setting up a new account, but after that. Everything works just fine. No complaints. I would recommend this product for the little ones for road trips."
NolimitMarine,5,Terrific tablet for everyone,"I can't stop using it. It's all you ever need in a tablet, Netflix,Youtube,Facebook,Games,Music,Movies and much much more!!! Great screen resolution and all for an affordable price!!!!"
MJRI,5,Nice Fit,Good fit / feel in your hand when using this device.
Carlos,5,Excellent value!!,"Let's be honest, I didn't think I would be really satisfied with a $50 tablet. But I thought this would be good enough for web browsing, email and the occasional YouTube or Netflix video so I bought it. This tablet has exceeded all of my expectations. This Kindle Fire is better than the one I paid $200 for a couple of years ago (and comparable performance to my iPad3). It is more responsive and has an expandable microSD slot for more memory. The only detractors are the weak speaker, the cameras (only adequate for Skype, not for taking pictures, and the placement of the volume buttons (on top...would have preferred side buttons like almost every other smart device). However, I liked this so much that I'm going to get another one for my teenage daughter!"

Andy,5,Amazing for the price,"I bought this tablet to keep my ipad home during a trip overseas. I'm amazed with the performance of this tablet. It is fast, the screen is crisp and it provides pretty much everything I need. Cameras and speaker are low quality but not a deal breaker for me. I don't take pics with my ipad and usually use headphones. Free games from Amazon underground, free Amazon cloud for three months a the peace of mind it gave me; made this purchase a great decision. It also,makes a great reader. Love this little gadget.."

MRMVS,5,Best Value Ever,I own several iPads but wanted to try one of these as I am an Amazon Prime member. These are a STEAL and what a value. The fact that you can insert a micro SD card to expand storage is a huge plus and I have been very pleased with the availability of APPs. I will be taking my this to Europe and have been able to download a bunch of movies for the trip from my Amazon Prime membership. I purchased at Best Buy with a gift card and now use it more than my iPad.

Gely,4,Good,"Amazon Fire Tablet: Catch up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments or chat with friends."
Shirley,3,It's great for beginners.,I like the size of it and it's easy to operate. I didn't like that I had to keep trying to put the same information in more than once to more from one screen to another when putting in my card information. I need to have wifi to look at the stuff I downloaded and I don't like that. But for the cost it's ok.

TeeCee46,5,Great tablet for kids,"I purchased 2 Fire tablets for my foster children, and I must say , I love them! The Fire give parents so much control over what the kids can do it.

Red0328,5,Excellent Product,Purchased for my son for ease of use and design. Would recommend.
bestbuyer,4,"Not an IPad, but amazing for the price","Bought to replace a work issued IPad. Some differences I've noticed:+survives repeated drops off the loft to the floor, unlike ipad+small, lightweight, fits in my small purse or daybag+cheap price means I'm willing to travel with it, take it anywhere, leave it at work unlocked- I don;t worry about theft like with apple devices-more limited apps available than ipad, but most major apps are there (but not my favorite list making app)-silk browser forgets that tabs were closed and always reopens to whatever page you've been browsing lately (but might make for a good accidental parental watch/ control to see what the kids surfed last)-standby battery lasts several days, active use all day, but not like my ipad, where I could leave it on standby for weeks, shorter standby battery life for the FireI use mostly for web browsing, social media, and Kindle books. no other cons noted."

auststry,4,Good for the money,I bought two of these items. The first was for my mother in law. She is visually challenged and it was recommended by her doctor. The second I received as a fathers day gift. The first one had issues that required a return and replacement. It now works fine. Exchanged at Best Buy with no problem. The only problem I see is the limitation on available apps. But that is a minor issue at this point. For the money you can't beat it.
Karen,5,Love the Kindle Fire,I have had my Fire for 5 years at least and love it. Bought this for my mother. Her IPad died. She is enjoying it. Her only issue is there is a game she can't download because it is on Google play.

JoAnn,3,good tablet for my grandson,"Not sure of quality. His first Kindle Fire would no longer charge properly. It was cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed. He has already had a problem with this one charging properly; however, I believe the problem might have been with the charging cord and not the tablet itself."

NickKentK,4,Great buy!!,Can't beat the Fire tb at $50. Was able to root it in about 5min to get google apps installed and use it like an android tab. I mainly bought for reading to use the blue shade feature which is great. Only complaint is the processor is little lacking compared to phones with the same specs
snake,4,A good tablet for a beginner.,A very good price for the tablet. The sound volume is a little low. Needed someone with technical knowledge to help me set-up the tablet.
BEACHMOM717,4,Great tablet for kids,"I bought this Fire for my son for primarily reading. Definitely not as good as the antiglare ones. If I were buying again for that purpose I would upgrade to the ones specifically for reading. As a tablet, it is a little difficult to navigate. It seems very cluttered. Does the job though."
BEACHMOM717,4,Great inexpensive tablet for kids,"We bought this tablet primarily to use the kindle reader. The layout is muddy and things are a bit hard to navigate. Once you figure it out, it isn't bad. Not an iPad, obviously, but definitely worth the low price."

He is 70 and not too tech savvy but is able to browse the Internet, use Skype and listen to music. He is afraid he will purchase something by mistake and get a charge on his credit card. :)"
MurkumMike,5,Easily a deal and a steal at the same time!!,I recently bought this for my son who HP tablet died on him a month before I got him the Fire. Best thing I've done!! It didn't cost a lot and it's made solid with beautiful deep colors and smooth video playback. I'm seriously thinking of buying one for myself soon.

Ndfan123,5,Good tablet,I got this for myself. The price on this is amazing for what you get. Yes I would of liked to get an iPad because I'm very used to Apple an I have a iPhone but the price difference between these it pretty much a no brainier for me.
Mommyof4,5,Great for all ages!,"We looked into tablets for three of our children for Christmas. There were three things we looked for: the ability to use it for books, games and videos and our ability to control the activity. The kindle fire gave us all those and more. I love that we can increase the storage when/ if we want to. I love that we can control play time. I was concerned because all of our kids were used to our iPad, but they have had no issues adjusting to the change. We are extremely happy with this purchase!!"
Jen1983,5,Fantastic little tablet.,"I love my tablet so far! It does everything I need it to. Movies, music, games, and books. I love it for streaming movies. The video quality is fantastic. Reading is also super easy and I don't get headaches from the screen. Definitely happy. Bought my hubby one too."

musicman53,5,very easy to use,nice pickup for my wife who is just learing to use a tablet
Gardenlady3,5,A great tablet for the money,I have used tablets before that cost a lot more money. For the price this tablet is a bargain.
RCZon,1,A great tool to use to read and surf the internet.,I love using it to read and surf the internet. It is also very handy.
rydellLB,5,Best 50 dollar tablet on the market.,"Got this for my eight year old son. But wanted to keep it for myself after testing it out. Good graphics, camera front and rear. Camera resolution as good as could be expected for 50 bucks. Access to play store apps a plus. All in all good 50 bucks spent."
Rochelle,4,Great for kids,Lots of apps for kids. My 5yr old loves it. Great buy.
Michelle,4,Needs longer cord.,Already lost the cord. It should be longer so u don't forget it. Especially on vacation.
TheFamily,3,Great for the price,I purchased two of these for my kids since they both wanted tablets for Christmas. We liked that they could use it like their own but we had total control of what the used and viewed. It is a lot faster than the older Kindle. It is pretty durable as well.
alyssa83,5,Great for kids!,This product is great for kids! Not so expensive or fragile that you have to be super careful with it but great for the basics!
Ram1athon,4,Good value,Internet sucks on this thing. They need to do something better. My phone is 3x faster.
John,5,Fantastic for the price,"I bought this tablet as a gift for my mother-in-law, who is not very tech-savvy. She already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching TV, rather than a whole laptop. She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself. Popular apps like Netflix, Skype, and Facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native Android."
BigErica4,5,Good product,My daughter can never put her fire tablet down she really loves it
Weezie07,3,Great Tablet for beginners,I purchased this for my stepdaughter. well her dad and I are no longer together we divorced 2 yrs ago. Both her parents could not purchase this for her. So Merry Christmas little one. She loves it . Easy to learn great for pictures
KumasDaddy,5,Great cheap alternative to an IPad,"I picked up 2 of these for my girls (ages 5 and7). They are constantly on them to play games and watch movies. At $50 each, these are great alternatives to an IPad. Also, there is no angst if they are lost or broken."
Dutch,5,Met my expectations,Can not beat the quality of the product for the cost.
poobie12,5,Great for a Teenager!!!,"My Grandson loves this tablet. With all of the Apps, and the Games also!"
Dellie,1,Great for my grandkids and mother.,"I totally love the Kindle Fire tablets purchased for my grandkids. My sister purchased one in our hometown for my mother. She is equally happy. My granddaughter and grandson spend their wind down time in the evening on the tablets playing their favorite games. In addition, they want a dog and conduct research for the type of dog that the would like. Overall, the tablets are easy to use and provides technology for them when they visit every other weekend. I am pleased."
LAW123,4,This is great for my 9 year old son.,I was able to get this for a great price an my son is able to read books and of course play games. Great price and purchase!!!
Tlooloobell,4,Cheap tablet for kids,"I wish I purchased the warranty, this kindle is glitchy and pixelly (if that's even a term) and also freezes"
Movie,5,Perfect tablet for our son.,Purchased this tablet for a 9 yr old and it's perfect. Easy to use and very durable. He is very happy.
Maggie,4,Good tablet,Nice budget tablet fast and does the job. For the price is a nice tablet.

Horse,3,Good,"It is not as easy to use as my iPad. There is no Retina display , which I got used with my Apple gadgets"
br00klyn0716,5,Amazon tablet,Great product. Purchased for my wife to replace her fire hd. She loves the screen and the fact that it fits in her pocketbook.
Black,4,Great Product,"I bought one for my daughter, so I decided to buy one for me the tablet is very user friendly."
Mills,4,great quality for the price.,"This is just a basic kindle fire for my 7 yr old child. It works fine for her. It obviously doesn't have comparable picture quality when compared to the HDX versions, but it still has the same functions. It does have a rear and forward facing camera, making it easy to take pictures of the dog. There are lots of safety features and apps for kids also."
Lee8,5,Great product,I love this kindle! My old one lasted about two years before it died so hopefully this one will hang in a little longer because I use it all the time.
Boyd,4,Good starter,"Can't beat the price and features on this tablet. All the features are competitive even with Amazon's proprietary operating system and appstore. Most common Google play apps are available, but if they're not, chances are there is something analogous. Navigation can be a little cumbersome as it isn't as customizable as some might like, but bottom line is, it's a pretty full feature tablet for fifty bucks."
24soontobe5time,4,it's alright,"I bought for the wife, she's still using her old one. don't know why"
fawadaziz,5,Very good tablet for this size,You can't go wrong either with Kindle or with the price. Very good buy.
proudamerican632,5,Son loves his fire.,"He loves the games, that he can down loaded boos, music and videos."
emom04,4,Good tablet,"This is a good tablet for basic functions. It was smaller than I expected. We had a Fire when they first came out and I was thinking it would be the same size. The screen size is very small, but I guess that is why it was $49 instead of more expensive. It is good for reading, basic games and kids. But if you want to surf the web, it is really hard to see more than the top few inches of the webpage. It is great with the 8G, but would like a bigger screen for that price! :)"
Aprilmoe,5,Great Tablet,"I bought this tablet for my dad for Christmas and he loved it! I had to show him how to use it (of course), but now he has the hang of it!! Great buy!"
Bgreensd,5,Good purchase,"Love it ,great product for a great price. Will be getting another one"
cedd,5,very fun item for young kids to play on,"Good product, needs a few more things added on but works very well"
Tyler,5,Great screen resolution,I bought 2 for my 4 and 5 year old and thet love it.
Lisa,5,Good tablet for basic apps,"Great tablet. Love reading my books, playing puzzles, and going on basic social apps."
Lestersavage,5,Very user friendly,The Amazon fire 8 is by far one of the easiest tablets to navigate through all the Apps and with PRIME membership it's truly a very easy and good sturdy design.
FireNina,4,Perfect for a 6yr old!,Purchased as a gift for 6yr old boy. He can now play all the games he wants without having to share with big brothers!!
fdny,4,great tablet for children,"Pro -Inexpensive, compact device.Con - lack of protective covers"
bethal17,4,Great basic tablet,"I purchased this because I wasn't sure how a tablet would work for me, and wanted to buy an inexpensive ""starter."" I was quickly sold on the convenience and ease of use. The ads are a minor issue - they go away with the swipe of a finger! I'm able to watch tv and movies, access the internet via Wi-Fi, play games, and send email with ease. (Be aware - this tablet does come with a 30-day trial of Amazon Prime, and if you don't cancel before the end of that trial, it automatically enrolls you.)"
Steve,4,Surprisingly great!,"My wife gave this to me for Christmas and one for my daughter. For the money, I thought it wouldn't be worth it, but I was wrong. It is really way more powerful than I thought. I can do Word and Excel, PowerPoint, pdf's, work email, surf the Internet, movies, books, games...pretty much everything I thought I needed to spend 10X the money to get. I'm very surprised and happy with it. Only two I would change: a better picture and stop the ads on waking. This is a great value."
Denise,5,I'm happy!,"Great price for the device. Many options, easy to use!"
JenniferW,4,Perfect for any age,I purchased this tablet for my son to use after realizing he took mine over almost completely. He has no problems navigating from game to game. Excellent speed and love the HD screen.
paulec,5,like it better then my tablet,Works very well. Was able to get it to work with my tablet and all our Samsung phones. Easy to setup family app's with Amazon prime.
Mike,4,Great for the price,"Smooth and quick operarion. Ap store for Amazon could be better, but pretty good value for the price."
Sparky9579,5,Great entry level tablet/E-reader,"A great entry level tablet, all other tablets at that price don't stack up."
Mike,5,Great for games,"Good tablet for games,adds and imails. Also good size"
CindyDiG,5,Perfect Gift,My high school aged daughter just wanted a small tablet to watch Netflix and read books. This tablet is the perfect fit and I don't have to worry about her carrying around her expense iPad to school. I'm thinking about getting one for Grandma too.
Blondie,5,Great tablet for kids,My children love this tablet. It's fun and easy for them to use!
rcalderon86,4,Good tablet for the price,Tablet gets the job done and is very affordable for those who cannot buy an iPad but it is laggy at times and overall cannot stand with an iPad.
Dort,5,Love My Fire,This fire tablet has handled all of the facebook games I play without skipping or tieing up.I'm very impressed.
Beyonce1,3,Great,"Bought this as a gift for my niece but I use it every now and then. She loves it, gives her ebook, music, videos, games etc... All in one through Amazon without having to get any external apps, most already built in. I like it as well except not so much the platform and navigating around it."
Jmsjms,5,Great product,This item is a great product. Let's me use it for different things.
Mama87,4,Love the camera,I like it alot it has the basics that my children needed and even my husband loves it so we will be coming back for a few more :)....
Nush,5,Easy to use,"Bought for my grandchildren,easy for them to use, Great downloads for kids,they love the easy to use camera.Great prices.The book downloads for them to read.I highly recommend this product,for anyone who has children!"
Mhudson,4,Great buy,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!! One thing I dont like is the charger doesnt stay in well. Its ok because I just rig it up and leave it on the charger over night. Only other complaint would be she can't download same games as her brothers tablet. Other than that absolutely great buy for $49.
dim5um,5,Easy to use,Practical and easy to use. Does what it needs to for the price
KennedyFriedPatron,5,My First Tablet.,"I never had a legitimate reason for owning a tablet. I prefer watching shows and movies on my TV and I prefer reading actual books as opposed to a tablet. However, when I learned that Best Buy was selling this Amazon tablet for $34.99 on Black Friday, I knew that I had to get my hands on one. Even with the aforementioned reasons for not getting one, I couldn't argue with that price. I think it's a great starter tablet. It may not have the largest screen or HD quality but then again I don't need all of that. The quality and size of the screen are perfect for that price. 8GB may not be a lot of memory but there is also an option to get more storage via a memory card. I very much satisfied and recommend this tablet to anybody, especially those who are curious about tablets and haven't purchased on yet."
Momma777,4,Okay,Okay new look is less appealing but seems to work okay
Raxs51,4,Amazon Fire tablet,I used it as a gift in an office holiday secret Santa

LAEngineer,5,Great Tablet for Kid,"I purchased as a gift for a five year old, and he loves it. He has downloaded several educational games, and he loves it. Very easy to use, and has a great battery life. The price is great, and the tablet is great for the amount you pay."
Jasot217,5,Great for my 5 year old,"This is a great tablet for my 5 year old boy. It was inexpensive at $35 on black Friday. I particuly prefer it because, with my Amazon prime account, I can download videos to it. Amazon only let's Amazon products download videos. It was great when we traveled at Christmas. No more dvds and player needed!"
Shawn,5,Great E reader,I purchased this tablet to read books online and I love it the screen is nice.

goddessfuri,5,Just What I wanted.,"This is a great tablet, just the right size. I wish the cord was longer, but it was still really good. It stays charged for the right amount of time."
AmericanTalibanMan,5,Fun,For the price you can't beat it. Camera isn't the best as for zooming in but it takes good picture's. I also long the storage expansion
kindle,2,better tables around,Very nice size. Now only 50$. There's no Google play store so can't use Google Chrome cast to watch movies on tv. A tablet Without a Google play store is a disadvantage.
jenden,5,great for young granddaughter,Bought it for young granddaughter for Christmas. Husband liked it and bought himself one.
CheezCayke,5,Great little tablet for the money,"Fabulous little tablet for the money. Light and zippy. A few limitations on available apps and external hardware but if you just want something to access email, read a book or stream video this is the way to go.I needed this as an early December birthday present for an older lady whose old tablet had quit working. She loves it.Also Best Buy came through when Amazon was already out of their own product before it was even December."
MattB,4,Nice product,If you're watching TV and playing games this is for you. Don't waste money on a iPad. This is great for reading too. Bought for a fireman spending long hours at the firehouse.

Astasha,5,Best gift for mom!,My mom's not to tech savvy but this opened her world and made every day things she does on her computer at her finger tips while comfortably sitting in her living room or on road trips! About road trips she can book a room just sitting in her car that might of unavailable once she got Inside. I have seen this happen. Smart phones are great but when you get older to have a full screen makes it much easier! She loves also loves to read and there are so many books on Amazon she no longer has to run out the door to the book store or library Very helpful and fun when she can sit down and enjoy a card game with multiple players all over the world when no one is home!
DJW1,4,7 Inch fire,This Fire is a bit smaller than my Kindle Fire from a few years back. I still seems to have all the features and is 1/2 the price.
Crosspussler,4,Inexpensive tablet,"Delivered a crisp display but had trouble with the keyboard size, using a stylus helped!"
Brett,4,Great for price!!,This great for the money but it won't let you use Spotify??
waasaa,2,i had to return it,my gesr fit heart monitor was not compatible with android level
StokedRider,3,A Mixed Bag,"Pros:CheapFunctions wellUsually pretty fastCons:Wifi signal isn't as strong as more expensive tabletsScreen pales in comparison to other Kindle'sFrequent burn-inIf you're looking for a cheap tablet that works, this does that.

PsycoJohnny,5,Great Product,"Can do everything the regular kindles can do, but in full color. My Wife loves it and is always reading magazines and watching movies."
Mike,5,Affordable,"The tablet is not top of the line, but for using it for games, reading, watching movies, it works great. A lot of inexpensive tablets are junk but Amazon has put out a reliable product. I would recommend also getting a micro sd card."

Shopper54,5,Great gift!,I bought it for my son-in-law. He loves it! He wanted it as another device instead of his iPhone. This way he won't be disturbed by emails when using it. It was a great price too!

Dawgswhat5,5,Kindle Fire,"I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day. She loves reading but with the little ones in the house books were hard to keep. We are both very pleased with this as I can use it for a few books too. The picture and color on this thing is pretty darn good. I'm pleased with the sound as well. Overall this price is too good to pass up if you want a color screen reading tablet, this is a solid choice."
Monkey20,4,Nice electronic device,I got this product for my 2 year granddaughter to play games on. I am currently checking into purchasing the monthly $5 kids mode for her as it now has many pop ups.
3Greenbeans,5,Great teaching tool for middle school children,"My kids love these tablets, they can use these tablets for school and leisure.

BH2010,4,Awesome for the price,"For the price, it's the best tablet you're going to find. It's pretty quick (though not as quick as the more expensive models) and holds a ton of books and a decent amount of movies. Display is nice (again, not as nice as the more expensive Kindle Fires). But it is totally worth what I paid for it."
MoodyRyan,4,a great purchase for the price,"I bought the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet while walking around and saw the price 34.99 at the time. got home and set it up immediately and added the Play store app by Google ( a bit tricky ) the device is nice to hold , battery is above average and the screen is nice to look at. my kids started using it and after that , I couldn't even get a turn to play with it. it's a great device for the $$ , even at regular price of 50 dollars, it still is a good purchase. my only ""concern"" about it is that I wish it had another 1 gig of ram , totalling 2 instead of just 1 gb ram. enjoy :)"
Airman,5,Best Tablet For The Money Hands Down!,As a tablet compared to others regardless of price I'd score it above average but the other tablets in comparrison cost $100+ more. This is the best buy for your money...hands down as long as you have amazon prime (which is awesome on its own).

Since I was not 100% sure as to what brand to purchase one of your sell staff advised me that I should purchase 4 Google Play gift cards, which I did. To my surprise, on Christmas morning, my grand children were not able to use them because (as your staff should have known) they are not compatible! I took them to the store to exchange them and I learned that not only that Best Buy would not exchange/refund them but that you don't carry the Amazon cards. You have just last a good customer when it comes to purchasing some items that I can purchase online at amazon or another store. I purchased an hp PC and a 12"" Apple IPad at another store just to make a point. I was and still are very disappointed with your sales staff, and your sells practices. I will recommend the tables to a friend but stay way from asking assistance when purchasing the right gift cards..."

Nerdbucket,5,Limited but Useful,"Bought the Fire as a way to have a cheap and easy device for my kid to play on when I want/need the iPad, and as a secondary e-reader. I have Amazon Prime, so adding this device to my account/Amazon ecosystem was incredibly easy. I find the ease of purchasing Amazon items both slick and kind of creepy--but I knew that was part of the deal, buying an Amazon device. I can tune it out when I need to, and parental controls are easy to manage. The device is quick/responsive; color, brightness, and resolution are all quite good for a $50 device. It doesn't do everything but it does a heck of a lot for 50 bucks."
Robert,4,Nice screen.,What a great price and very easy to use.Had a little trouble getting past my secured connection though.
Charlie,1,Very Disappointed!,"This tablet disappointed me from the beginning. I loved my previous Fire tablet. However, this new one disappointed me from get go. I do not want it to tell me what I like or want! I do not like ads that pop up, I do not want suggestions for me on books, movies or anything else. I know what I like! I definitely do not want it talking to me! In this day and age, with identity theft prevalent, I would like to be able to have apps without having to turn on features like location, etc.. All in all, I am ready to bust it up and throw it away!"

I'm not making a big deal of it because I bought it on Black Friday (not that I have money to waste), but I don't think I'd buy it again."

Debb,3,"It's ok, that's all","It is too narrow, if watching a vid or utube, some of the pic is cut off. Can't erase the entire history. It keeps it and then recommends still based on your history, even tho you have cleared it. Amazon selling ALL the time is very tiresome. I never go to an ad that follows me from site to site yet it's ubiquitous. Tiresome. Had the fire 8.9 hdx. It was Perfect and they discontinued it for this line. It is a fingerprint magnet! Have to clean it daily."
RecycleKing,5,Pixels and Purchaces,The Fire HD Tablet is portable and very easy to use. It can be held in one hand. The device holds multiple software application options and provides a fantastic blue screen mode at night while reading. I bought three more units when the price dropped to $33 each. The screen is only slightly pixelated compared to other models due to its price point. I would recommend to others.
Royalty,5,Great buy,Really enjoyed purchasing thus product for little ones
Deni,5,Kindle fire,"Best tablet for kids will buy again. Purchased about 5 already,good for whole family"

maintenance,5,Christmas gift,This will be great for my parents who are older because it easy to use.
1234abc,5,Great price!,Great price. Very Easy to use. My grandson loves it.
DashLM,4,Perfect. Petite.,This table does everything you NEED.. not necessarily everything you want. But It's great for the $$ you pay and it's really handy. I take it around with me all the time.
BrennanK,5,I Absolutely LOVE It!,"I am so impressed with all the things this little tablet can do. It's NOT just an eReader, although that's what I purchased it for. The clarity is so improved from my old Kindle Fire, which I dearly loved for years (until my puppy got it). I was flabbergasted at all the things this little tablet can do...and it was so much less expensive than my other tablet. WHAT A DEAL!"
Murdoc,1,Didn't work first time powered on,"The first time I buy my first tablet it came on but it only showed that it needed to reeboot, it then shut off by its self."

sandy,5,Good Quality for the price,It is a good buy for the price and the performance is also awesome
Babygrylsmom,3,Not a happy customer,My daughter's Google tablet had run its course so I purchased this. I miss the simplicity of android.
EdiSan,4,Solid Entry-Level Tablet.,I use an Iphone but I needed a reliable Android machine to play many android games I've purchased. This fits the bill and runs Android fairly well for the price. Don't expect to push TOO much power out of this model but with some clever tweaking you can get this thing to bypass the Fire OS and do all your Android app needs.
KittySue,5,Great price,"Bought this kindle for myself, can't wait to open it."
Ricky,4,Great tablet for the price,This is a great tablet for the money. It gets 4 stars because there are some things that could be better. The tablet has some lag to it at times while trying to perform some operations. However reading books or watching videos is great once the connection establishes. If you understand that it's not gonna act like a more expensive feature filled tablet this is great.
James,4,Good but not apple,Good product for the price. Obviously it is not as simple to use as iPad or galaxy but still a great option for those who don't want to break the bank
Lbchop,5,Great tablet,"I purchased this Kindle Fire 7 on sale. It was a no brainer. It is faster than my 2012 Fire HD 7 thought the screen resolution cannot compare to the 2012 Fire HD 7. Screen resolution is adequate and for my use as an every day ereader, web browser, email it is perfect. I haven't used the cameras so cannot comment. I tested them out and they seem OK."
Jcole360,4,Great tablet,This is a great tablet. For reading and for games. Good for kids & adults overall.
MissNini,5,Petite and very easy to use!,A tablet that is not too large with great clarity!

Mhitech,4,Great Fire,nice for this price................................
ariusvideo,3,Nice inexpensive tablet...if you're tied to Amazon,"We bought this for the son of a family friend. From what we can tell they like it. Not the highest resolution screen and you have to be tied to Amazon services to really enjoy it, but it's definitely a nice functioning tablet."
BestBuyLover,5,Kindle Fire,"I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I love it! You can play games (Although a bit laggy), watch movies/TV shows, read, and do quite a bit with it! The price is amazing! I would for sure buy this again and again! I recommend this if you are wanting a tablet to read! It is a great price for a pretty big screen! (But if you are wanting more of a game tablet I would recommend an Ipad or whatever is at best buy that they recommend.) I definitely think there is enough gigs for a few games and some books! My rating is 10/10!"
Awesome,5,Nice tablet,The kindle is my favorite tablet for reading books
Shonda,5,Great tablet,"Will recommend to friends and family, best tablet I bought"
NicoleP,5,Great for anyone,"I researched several different e-readers before deciding to purchase this tablet. This one was the best fit financially and it also allowed me more flexibility to access books from my local library. That feature alone is very valuable. I may decide to upgrade to something with less glare for outdoor reading, but for now this is perfect. Very easy to keep in my bag and since I am an android user this was not difficult to learn."
pingpong,4,good for light user,good for light user. I bought 49+tax. It is worth than price.
Amanda,5,Great Kindle Fire,This is a great Kindle. It has great sound and clarity of the screen. Easy to use.
Jason,4,Wife's present,I had got the original for the wife she finally needed a new one so when I saw this online I had to get her a new one she loves it
Rage1,4,Perfect Mother's day Gift,I bought this as a mother's day gift for my mother. She has not had much experience with tablets. This was a perfect choice for her. Doesn't do anything. Crazy but works great for free to play games and kindle books and apps.
Steph,5,Great tablet for reading,"We had purchased these same tablets for our kids for Christmas and we really liked them. I like that they have kindle unlimited. I don't constantly have to buy books, like with my Nook. $10 a month for unlimited and I can read all the books I want"
Meghan,5,Great for the Price!,Perfect for the price. Great for kids to play games. Good battery life too!
pharmacyfella82,5,perfect for my needs,picked up this fire tablet for the simple reason of reading ebooks purchased through kindle rather than on my phone. it's small enough I can stash it in my bag and easy on the wallet if anything happens to it. go ahead and pick up a case for it and maybe a glass screen protector for added piece of mind
Smitty4687,5,Great for children,Bought for my son and he loves it. Fast and great for playing games
gremlin,5,Great tablet for a starter.,"I used a couple of the brands that are just priced under this product and well...you get what you pay for!  This tablet was much easier for my granddaughter to learn on. She can access her camera, pictures, videos, and games, much better than the ""other brand""."
BigRed,5,Excellent tablet!,Amazon Fire tablet is one of a kind!! Very easy to use and adaptable to fit all needs!
chipolopo,4,The tablet is good for the price,I needed something bigger than my phone screen to browse with and came across this tablet. The screen quality is good
DataFinder,5,Great gift,"Looking for a present for that young professional or graduate, this is great. They love technology."
Anie4,3,Good for kids,Bought this for my 12yr old son. Can't get him off of it. Gave it 3 stars because it doesn't support google play store and doesn't load most pics on pinterest sometimes. You might need a memory card if you purchase 8gb tablet.
maxinthestars,5,Excellent,I got this for a friend so she could use the internet and have more entertainment. I was happy with the cost.
Boss,4,Great product,Definitely got the job done. This tablet is nice size and affordable
Michael,4,"1st one died quickly, 2nd one still going","So far the only complaint I have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product. I had one for just about 2 weeks when I noticed a definite issue staying connected. My wife, who has had her Kindle Fire for months, said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it. I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. They said that's Amazon's policy. I contacted Amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new Kindle was on the way to its new home. I've been pleased with it since its arrival. It does most of what I need (email, facebook, minimal web use), saving ""wear & tear"" on my laptop."
Wallyworld,5,Get for books,Got it for my wife but I keep it. Got to get her one now.lol
RyDRunner,4,Great Tablet at a Great Price,Bought this tablet for my kids and they love it. The Fire allows them access and freedom to a tablet without the high cost.

Krissi,5,Sweet,Love my tablet. I'm not used to using amazon but its good now
Nicky,4,Ok tablet for someone who just wants to read,We bought the tablet for my 1 year old who normally uses my iPad and Samsung tablet because we wanted him to have his own so we could have ours. He was very disengaged. I believe it's because it didn't have the home and back button like our tablets do. Over all it's an amazing device it just didn't keep our little one entertained
unchartedwaters,4,not bad for the price,good starter tablet or great for games. fits in the purse or coat jacket.it was on sale for 50 dollars
Roberto002007,5,Great tablet,My daughter had been asking for a tablet she loved it and since likes to watch movies and play games and take a bunch of pictures i like that you can expand the memory up to 128 gigs.
Kainoy,5,Great Tablet,I read many of the reviews about this tablet prior to purchasing it and was so glad that I did. It's a great tablet.Simple to use at a price that can't be beat.

BestGuy,4,Great For The Price,I would recommend this product to anyone that loves reading e-books.
Dick,5,Great for my 8 year old,It does every thing I need it to do for my son. It is very helpful when we are doing homework.
Deenee,3,Can't download certain apps,"Can't download ""TCM"" nor my Cable providers "" tv on the go"" app"
CarlosEA,5,Amazon Kindle,THESE WERE BOUGHT FOR YOUNG BOYS. SO FAR NO PROBLEMS. VERY DURABLE. VERY CAPABLE.

1grammyk,4,good starter tablet for our young grandson,Santa brought it for our our grandson. We got a shock case for it and he plays and watches kids videos on it every day while his older siblings are playing games on theirs. It was a little money well spent on a kids tablet.
andywilk,5,Easy to use,The screen on this tablet is very nice- good picture.
Mobilestar,5,"Amazon - Fire - 7"" Tablet - 8GB","I bought two Amazon - Fire - 7"" Tablet - 8GB on sale for $39.99 (Reg. $49.99), at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only spent $30.00, saved $20.00 for one tablet and another one 2 months later with another coupon for even less for my elderly mother. Both 7"" tablets exceeded my expectations and then some. I downloaded all my apps for my Amazon account and Google Play Store. Setting Kodi was as easy as Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, just download the apps. I love this tablet, it works very well. I bought it because I love to check my e-mails etc. Having a 7"" screen makes it all easy and simple. As far as apps go, it has Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and tumblr available. It does not have Instagram available at the Amazon Store, but it does have it at Google Play Store. This Amazon Fire 7"" tablet is so lightweight, and you will love it too. As far as technology, it's an awesome tablet for the price, it's one of the nicest size tablets you can get your hands on. It's perfect for a child or an elderly person, to enjoy anywhere. I would highly recommend this tablet."
Sand,3,Slow slow slow,Very slow.My 73 year old mother loves it.I would recommend this to a elder or a young child.
Desperado,4,With it for the price,I really enjoy my kindle. My only issue with it is that I can't get some of the apps I normally use however it does have most of them.
Jakester,4,Better than older models,"Was please to find out that a camera, albeit not real high in pixel density but still usable, was now available along with a memory slot. Older model died and was getting real slow due to not enough memory. Good for a book reader, not so for a full featured tablet."
SamsungGuru,5,Great inexpensive tablet.,Bought it for a friend for Christmas. They like it and use it everyday. Definitely recommend it for others.

Nikki,5,"Great product, great price.",Exceeds all expectations and perfect fit for my 9 year old.
Sherry,5,Good,"Great tablet, I bought 3 for my grandkids and now another for another grandkid."
willsmith,4,Works fine,The fire works fine it's not the fastest but for basic browsing and watching videos it works great. You can't beat it for the price. Great for kids and not having to worry about them breaking it.

Amanda,5,Great tablet for reading,This was a great tablet for reading and searching the web!

Rook12man,4,Great tablet,"Great value, does everything you want it to do. I would recommend to those who want a simple tablet experience."
Dixiegal,4,great for the price,"I really enjoy the Fire tablet. The only drawback is the short battery life. However, for $49, it's a great buy. In fact, I recommended it to a family member. If battery life were better, I would give it a 5 star."
Nano,5,Good reader,"I really like it, I can see the letters perfectly and it has a perfect size"

Does exactly what it should and is easy to use.Decent size for surfing the web. Has a good screen, easy to read text.Nice to be able to surf the web, read a book or listen to music."
Jocelyn,5,Worth buying,"I bought mine in store, I like having what I buy right away, so I didn't feel the need to buy it online, maybe that is why other people may have had a screen problem, could have been during the shipping process because who knows how well the shipping company treats the packages.I use it mainly for watching netflix, and reading books. I love it, feels like I have a kindle, and whats great about it is that its more than just a kindle so I can do more with it. I already have an iphone, and a huge laptop so I won't be using it for like everything like other people may need it for. So it is worth the price because before I was never planning on buying a tablet because I felt like they were expensive and since I already have a phone and laptop I didn't need it but when this came out I was finally happy to find a tablet that the brand is well known and popular."
Pecansam,5,"Great Tablet, Great Value",The new Kindle Fire's price point is amazing. At $50 this tablet is a full-featured device that is practically disposable.
Spartacus1,5,great tablet for a senior citizen just learning,"My old tablet had froze up on me, I was vacationing and I needed a new tablet, so I went to Best Buy and bought the Fire, easy to use and reasonably priced."
NativeTexan,5,Perfect for Amazon Prime,"Don't let the low price and screen size fool you. This 7"" tablet is a bargain at $50 and works flawlessly. It has long battery life and a bright display.

EricO,5,Great Tablet,Love this tablet. Has all the best features of a kindle and a regular tablet. It is easy to use and does exactly what it is supposed to do with zero fuss.
Junior,4,Great for basics,This tablet is a steal at this price. I would dare say it offers more per dollar than a high end tablet.
JWC101777,5,Can't Beat the price!,a $50 dollar tablet that will do more than an ipad...how can you go wrong!!!
spyderryder,5,Great Tablet,For the money this is most likely the best tablet available. This $49 tablet will do everything my Samsung Galaxy 4 will do. I wish Amazon had this available before I purchased the Samsung. I would highly recommend this tablet.
JasonL,4,Exactly as expected,My son has a 1st gen iPad and some of the newer games won't work for that operating system. I wanted a decent tablet that could play those games without locking up and not be as expensive. Amazon came through with this great product to meet my needs.
terry,4,Smaller than used too,I love my fire.It's a little smaller than I.m used to
Dante,5,Great tablet,"It is a must for Christmas gift, excellent product and price."

Mark,4,Great value,For $50 the kindle fire 7 is a bargain. I had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day. The only minus is amazon prime is now $99 a year and it's hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot. But still overall a great deal.
BradPolina,5,Best purchase I've ever made,"I love to have books read to me but don't want to have to pay for Audible. Since regular Kindles have long sonce done away with speakers, I had to go to the Kindle Fire line. I was blown away!

Mechanic361603,5,Great Tablet for the Price,"I love this tablet for reading and letting my son who is 4 play games on it. The resolution is not the best in the world but I do not use it to watch movies for hours on end. I wish it was not locked to the Amazon market so that I could get a wider selection of apps than offered, but still good buy nun the less."
outstanding,5,awesome tablet,"This tablet is fantastic. It's small yet biiger than my iPhone. It works fast and I've had no problems with it so far. Plus for the price, you can't go wrong with it. It's more than half the price of a Samsung or iPad yet works just the same. Don't hesitate to buy this"
nickstoner,4,Good purchase for travel use,Used while traveling in southeast Asia to pick up emails & stay in touch with friends & family back in the States
More2love,4,descent tablet for kids,This is a descent tablet for kids. Not all amazon apps are compatible with this is device which can get annoying. Storage is limited (8gb) so that too can get annoying. (Especially when 4gb is used before you ever get started.) Video quality is great but picture quality is lacking. Overall the tablet is easy to use and my children (8 & 12) enjoy using it. I gave it 4 stars because for the cost I think it is a pretty good tablet.
KellyGator74,5,Great device at a great price,I have bought tablets for others but this is the first time I bought for myself. This is a great price for a device that does everything.
Emc2natural,4,Meeting the need,I got this for my son. He is reading more now that he download the books to his tablet

Cole1659,4,Great tablet for covering the basic uses.,Bought a few of them on Black Friday for the family. While it's not my iPad it is comparable to any other tablet out there and performs well. The layout is unique which makes it a little difficult to get used to but it's by far worth the money.
Higgs7,5,Easy and fast,Quick starting and easy to use. This tablet is great for travel and games at night. E-mail checks are a snap. Low cost makes it something you do not need to worry about. Even supports e print to my HP printer. Buy 2 and enjoy it. No downside found yet.
sahil,5,Best for the price,Got it for 35 on BF.. the tablet is very good ..the processing speed and eveything. The only bummer is Camera but dont use it much
Mash81,5,Best tablet,This is the best tablet I have bought. It is better than the $200 kindle fire I bought a few years ago. It has wonderful apps for children as well as the great amazon apps I like!
ttroy5,4,Requires preliminary work beofre using,"I was giving the tablet as a gift for Christmas to a 3 year old. I initially purchased the ""standard version"" but returned it for the kid version which included a ""Bumper box"" as well as a 2 year warranty, which the standard version did not have. Thankfully, I asked the parent of the child if it was OK for me to set it up prior to giving it to the child. The set up took some time. I was thankful that I read the reviews because I bought an additional memory card since the product only has 8GB of storage. The child was able to open the gift and ""play"" immediately as a result of doing up-front work. One thing I noted that when the child played a movie through Netflix, the resolution was not very good. Could be an adjustment needed in the tablet, which has yet to be worked out. I would recommend this, but if giving as a gift for a child, I would recommend doing the up-front work so it is ready to go for the child when they receive it."
Dennis,4,Good tablet for reading,I bought this tablet for 1 reason to get back into reading books. It is perfect for that. Didn't really mess around with anything else.
Jude,5,Easy to use,I really enjoy the kindle fire.It is easy to use and fast.
ultramitten,5,Cant Beat the Price,"To start with, this is not a high end tablet. This serves the fundamental purpose of browsing and reading with so much ease. Believe me, a lot better than an a low end ASUS tablet. I own multiple tablets of varying brands. This tablet works like a charm. For the price offered, its worth the purchase."
Esha,5,Sweet gifts,Bought 2 of these for family members and they absolutely loved them! Connected to Wifi with no problems and downloaded apps quickly.
reyessal17,4,Greate steaming device,This is great to turn an ordinary tv that has an HDMI port into somewhat of a smart tv.
Boymama07,4,Bought for kiddos,Love the child profiles for my kids and all the parental controls! Great for price
Deanna,5,Replacement fire,I had a kindle fire that was about 4 years old and wore it out. This was purchased to replace that one and I love it. It is a little lighter and smaller. Still has all the great features and you cannot beat the price for this small tablet. I highly recommend it!
Dougless,5,Great display,The resolution is great and price is also well. Best tablet I. It's price range.
Doll,4,better than before,The Picture awesome. Memory card can be installed.

Bridget,4,Fast shipping.,Good: graphics & fast shipping. Bad: didn't like how it was like you couldn't get around putting in your credit card number.
willis46065,4,Very good value tablet,"This is a very good tablet for the price (about $50 regular price). Good image quality and battery life. Have been a Prime member for several years, so the included media access - videos, audio and books - is great. It is NOT an android tablet, so much of the Google ecosystem is not available. The Amazon AppStore has lots of options, but not nearly as many as the Google Play Store.Would recommend adding a microSD storage card. Also would get better file manager and video playback apps. There are several good, free options from Amazon's AppStore."
TitiRenee,4,Good inexpensive tablet,I purchase this tablet on Black Friday for my classroom while at work and my toddler while at home. Pros-I've mainly used it at work for Class Dojo and it's good for that purpose. At home I've used it for a Fisher Price ABC app. Both run okay with minimum lag. Cons-The volume is very low and the ads are annoying but for what I'm using it for it works.

Darthjmx,3,Decent Tablet,This is not a bad tablet for the price. I personally need a little more on high end side. The plastic look doesn't do it for me.It has a expandable Micro Sd Slot and decent battery life. I gifted it to the Mrs. and she loves it.
Denise,5,Bought for grandson,"My grandson had taken over his mom's kindle she got 2 years ago, so we decided to get her a new one and she loves it."
jeffbezos,5,Very good for the price,"My wife had a Nook e-reader that was getting old and also used her iPhone 5 for reading.

She has been very happy with it and you cannot beat the price for the features the tablet offers."
beg2differ,5,Fantastic budget tablet,We bought three of these while on sale. They replace my ereader and my children's ipod touches and we use them every day. I cannot stress how good of a deal this is! While the display isn't the best - you're getting far mor than what you pay for.

Gabriel,5,Free books,My wife is enjoying her new tablet because she is able to receive free books through her Kindle account!
Ro0011,3,Good Value,"I recently purchased this Amazon Fire for my daughter, i like that it has the little accent of a night light, so if we are watching a movie in the dark, she can still use it without illuminating the entire room. features are average, just like any other tablet. It is a little bulky but for a child, it gets the job done. Pretty sturdy when its dropped. Doesnt have much storage, but the good news is you can add your own SD to create more storage."

MadGamer,5,Great small tablet,Tablet is great for 7 inches. Touch screen works great
QueenMcBee,3,Torn,"I love this device for my kids who are way too young to trust with a $500 tablet such as an iPad. Works efficiently, my kids love it, & I love the parental control features. If something happens to it, amazon handles it quickly & if it were to break or get lost, it's cheap to replace. That being said, it obviously doesn't hold a candle to Samsung or apple's tablets. I'm not really a fan of the operating system."
Rufusmom,4,Best budget tablet,For the money (if you can do without Apple) this is the best tablet. You just have to remember Amazon sells it cheap so you have access to their media services and Alexa.

Fire,5,Just what I wanted,The fire meets my needs for my reading enjoyment. It is less cumbersome than always carrying around a book. I have no problems whether in daylight or at night. I would highly recommend this product.
Bert,3,OK for basic stuff,"Logging in with a password can be difficult since the typed lettersare not shown, even temporarily, so inadvertent typos require guesswork to find.Signing out of e-mail is not clear, if it can be done.Some ""free"" downloads fail because of lack of payment.Allowing for my lack of skills. I was hoping for a little more.It was OK fort basic stuff."
freerein,5,Great little tablet,This is a great little tablet. The price is unbeatable. I have been using mine for about a month. Never a problem. Easy to download good graphics and always plenty of free downloads to entertain!

Latinchef46,5,The fire tablet,"It is a great tablet, I bought it for my 11 year old and he uses it responsibly. I also bought the glass screen protector and the sky blue cover for it in case he drops it. My son loves it and enjoys being able to not only play games on it, or take pictures, or even movies, but most importantly for the use of the advantages of it for its help when it comes to his education. I strongly recommend this product to everyone."
Alex,4,Good cheap tablet,You could pay more and get something better but for reading comics and watching YouTube this is fine
style,4,Good Device,"My daughter uses this and loves it. The only complaint she had was she cannot get games from the google store because it will only allow game and app downloads from the Amazon store and Amazon does not have all the games. But as far as working, it does what it is supposed to."

FooledAgain,1,Tablet won't charge,"After only 4 days, the device would not charge. It was plugged in each evening and on the 4th day, it was at 7% after being plugged in all night. This was our second Amazon Fire Tablet, the first one stopped charging in month 13, right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. Decided to get another one because it was a great deal, but sadly I've learned you don't even get what you pay for with this tablet."
brittneyblr,5,great tablet,"Perfect tablet, such a great price would totally recommend"
Josephine,4,Amazon Fire,Bought for mother in law to play games on. Pretty simple to set up. Looked at other off brand tablets but the price on this was good so we went with it. Seems to enjoy it. Only got a call from her for how to connect to the Internet so I take that as a good sign since she's not tech savvy.
Rene,5,Love it!,"Best tablet ever!Cannot put it down! Always ready to read, browse or watch tv shows and movies"
Ternic1,5,Great reading device,The device is good for reading on. It feels like reading a book.
ITHK,2,Amazon Fire still have ways to go,"It was a cheap tablet just for kids to watch movies. However, it forces you to put your credit card numbers to register the product. I don't want to since kids will be playing with it. I don't want them to be able to purchase apps without approval. Reset it to factory default, but the setup changed not the same as first started. Anyway, I won't but it again."
monkeearms,4,Great Tablet,Tablet is great for the price. Not as fast as my S7 but pretty darn good for the price.

MinnNP,4,Good tablet for kids but no Youtube app,"I purchased for my grandchildren and they work fine for watching Netflix or Amazon movies, however, Kindle offers no app for YouTube which is a somewhat of a drawback for kids.

Happy4life,5,Brought for my 8 yo,"This was a gift for my son, who loves this tablet. It's easy to use, set up parental settings, and seems durable."
Ojthe7th,4,Good entry level Tablet,"Well, its a little weak but its cheap. Good for the Amazon Ecosystem if you don't want or need googleplay and all that. Can still side load apps, but some might not work correctly if you need a play account (like clash of clans will install but not let you log in) Some other things were a pleasant surprise that they actually worked, even though they were not officially sanctioned by Amazon. Battery life leaves a little to be desired and the tablet can get warm. Cameras are not good at all, but I guess would suffice for video chat. But for a name brand and only $50, there isn't really much room to complain. The ads don't get in the way much, but you would have to pay $15 to remove them. I would leave them and save the money. Bottom line, you can't really go wrong with the price."
jewyls01,5,Great tablet for my mom.,"My mom is not computer savvy, however she has really taken to the tablet. It is easy to us and just the right size for her to handle. So glad that Best Buy recommended this product for her."

Bigbang1,4,Good . . . . .,This is good tablet for price of $49.99. The camera is not really bad. One reason why i dont't like Amazon tablet and cellpone is you can't download some apps like magic jack and chikka apps. I like this 2 apps because im using it international.
Cancervivor,5,Excellent read!,Portability perfectBattery greatEase of use. Excellent
kalebmc,3,decent tablet but,"Not user friendly, in regards to compatibility with Google Play services, Play Store, etc. Definitely needs to be improved upon"
usual,5,Good Product,I am currently using this item. It is very good product.
kat2wolf,4,"Nice, but port for charger could be better",This tablet meets my needs for going online or killing time when I'm bored. The battery holds longer than my cell phone. The only problem with these is that the port you connect the charger into isn't aligned easily and is pretty cheap. I can see how the tip of the charger would break easily. That is really my only complaint since I only paid 39 dollars when it was on sale.
J1969R,5,AMAZON TABLET,I replaced my old tablet with this one. I like this tablet because it has a back light and I can read in bed without disturbing anyone else.
Readinglover,3,This is an ok Kindle for the price,The Kindle works as it should and was inexpensive but has a short battery life

spaulding4,5,Amazon Fire 8 - 8gb Tablet in Blue,"I love my Kindle & bought this for my mother for Christmas, she is very hard to get for but I know she will like it for the simple reason she can enlarge the letters just so she can see without having to put her glasses on. That in it self will mean everything to her. Now, she should be able to read her magazines or books or look something up online without any issues. Love Kindles!!"
Adam,5,An Excellent Value Tablet,"My daughter had her 8"" Kindle Fire HD stolen earlier this year so when we saw this one on sell over the Thanksgiving holiday it was a no brainier to purchase it since it was $100 cheaper than the Fire we purchased a year ago, granted the Fire HD has a much crispier screen but for my 9 year old daughter, she is now happy just to have a tablet again. And it can do all the things she needs it to do: read books, play games, skype, etc."

Grimmm,5,Great buy!!,A must have for your baby or child!! 100% Free apps!!
SkyIceFire,5,great for serious annotation/scripture study,"The main reason I purchased this was because I like to annotate scriptures and insert personal notes or related notes to passages especially meaningful to me. It's much easier to insert comments now with the keyboard display than it was to insert comments on the old Kindle I have, so that was a huge bonus. The one draw back/gripe I have is the ""back"" triangle button. The scriptures I read have hyperlinks that take me to other scriptures, and before on the old Kindle, I could hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page I was on. E.g., if I was on page 10, and selected a link to page 14, the back button would take me back to page 10. With this kindle, the back button takes you back to the library, and the previous page tap/swipe takes you back to the previous page, e.g., if I'm on page 10, and I take a link to page 14, it'll take me to page 13. The work-around that I discovered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more time-intensive than the old Kindle back button. The only other concern I have is the battery life. If I'm going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation (e.g., reading fantasy), I'll probably use my old Kindle. If I want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different commentaries (e.g., scripture study), the new Kindle is the better bet. The commentaries I reference are PDFs - I could create a Kindle book out of them, but it messes up the tables in the PDFs, and I don't care for the PDF viewer that came with the Kindle because you cannot bookmark the PDF or annotate it. I purchased a very inexpensive PDF app called ""exPDF Reader"" which does everything I want with PDFs. All-in-all, the Kindle - Fire is a great tool and fits into my lunch box, so I take it everywhere. I read that others were concerned about it's weight, but I find it to be light. I'm used to reading door stopper books, and it is definitely more manageable than one of those. A pleasant surprise I had was the ""blue shade"" feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cycle/quality of sleep. You don't need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old Kindle, so that's a nice perk too."
Mildoni,5,Very good tablet,"Believe it or not, I purchased this for my 3 year old Grandson, and he is doing real fine with it."

Eduardo,2,Just not worth it,"Was looking for a low-priced tablet to access my Kindle and magazine apps - specifically The Economist. What I didn't realize was that this was the ad-version of the Kindle, so removing ads on it would not be possible w/o fee - and worse, there's some limitation around some apps and everything located in the Google Play store, so apps like The Economist were not available. Sooooo... returned."
RAYMOND2XYZ,5,So far so good.,"I had the original kindle fire from many years ago that survived many a drop onto concrete floor without sustaining any damage, so I hope this one will last as long.

Sanfran,4,Wonderful little tablet. Easy to learn features.,"The tablet meets my immediate needs of email, games, even social networking. Also pleased with streaming of my favorite site. A little slow but maybe the network. Also Amazon's technical service was excellent.

MaPetti,5,Excelent cost for a Tablet,"Simple but effitient. I bought it to use mainly as a good cost benefit music player device.

makmcalli,5,Awesome Starter Tablet,Bought this for my father as he is in his 60s and never had a tablet before. He loves it and it works for all his needs.
BigE,5,Great tablet for kids,"Amazon's Free Time is a great tool for parents, making this a very good tablet for young kids. You can control when the Kindle turns off at night and when it can be turned on in the morning. You can control how many hours it can be used before shutting down, or you can specify hours by activity--books, videos, and apps/games. You can even set goals, such as 1 hour of books before allowing videos and games. And you control exactly what content they can access. And when your kid's not using it, you can use it yourself with your own unrestricted profile."
Makeda,4,Presents a easy reading surface,I had a Kindle earlier and rarely used it because the interface did not feel reading-friendly. This one is better. I am using it for two textbooks and find the interface improved. The purchase came with a free month of amazon prime which was a plus -- even though I decided not to renew after the month was over.
Carlos,5,Great Tablet for streaming and Browsing,Does what it says it does and is small and convenient!
Timm,5,Great gift,I give 1 of these put every month at work. It normally goes to their kids so they are the awesome parents.
Natasha,3,"Good eReader, Bad Battery and Horrible Storage","This Kindle is great for the price. However, there are some downsides to paying for a $50 tablet. The battery life goes very quickly, so daily charges are necessary if you're a heavy reader. You also can't save anything of merit like books or magazines to a mini-SD card, thus making a purchase of one a waste of time and money."
Ryanne219,5,Husband loves his kindle,"This is my husband's first Kindle, and he is so happy that he enjoys it. He plays on it almost every night."
LadyEsco702,5,Great tablet for children,This tablet works great for my 7 year old son. He loves it. The app store has plenty of apps. I would recommend.

safissad,5,nice for general use,I bought this for my niece and she seems to love it. Great for netflix and playing games. Of course you can also read books just like all kindles.
UR2SWEET,3,Best at its price,Best at its price. Just bought it because its less when compared ot other leading tablets. good for Skype.
Kevin,3,Best tablet for the Amazon Android Store?,"This is the possibly the best Tablet if you are an Amazon store/prime centric user. But, it doesn't include the Google Play Store and doesn't include most / any of the Google apps, which are stables in the Tablet world. No Google Inbox, etc. For me, this tablet is a ""skip"". But, it's cheap and if it meets your needs you might love it."
midmofan,4,Best Deal on low end tablet if Amazon Primer,"If you have an Amazon Prime membership, so that you are getting all of the videos and music, then this is a great table for tossing in your bag when on the go. It;s not the highest end, but works great with the Amazon features for a great price"
Steffi,5,It serves all my needs.,It works great for all like to surf on the internet.

svaddo,5,Great Value for an OK Tablet,$50 for a tablet is amazing. It does what it needs to do with not alot if frills.
Amber,4,Good deal,This is a good tablet for the money. Recommended for first time tablet owners.
cookiemonsters,4,excellent value,"I'm an avid android user, however you'd be very hard pressed to find an android tablet of this quality in this price range. The quality of this Amazon Fire tablet is really great. It is not HD, but that doesn't matter to my 9 year old, who uses it to play games and listen to music. It has extremely robust parental controls, allowing parents to set a child profile and then set screen time limits, bedtimes, and limit content available. The child profile is actually a little too restrictive in my opinion, as I think my 9 year old could handle something in between full unrestricted access to amazon content and kiddie games only. Overall I am very happy with this purchase."
Shiny151,4,Great tablet,Great value. I don't have any issues with this tablet. Some others mentioned ebooks were difficult to read but I don't have that problem. The storage is tight so I added a 64GB card to it. I use it every day.
PMac,5,Best tablet best price,"The Kindle fire tablet I purchased, is great for what I use it for, comparing prices&stores research, reading .perfect.best bang for your buck."
ShelleyP,5,Perfect for my son,Finally a perfect tablet for my son. With the addition of the memory card my son is able to play the apps he wants and still have his school apps on it! I am still able to use the parental settings to keep him safe. We all really enjoy this new Kindle and the price!!
Herb,5,Great tablet,Love the Fire - play games on it every day. It is small enough to carry with you but powerful enough to watch movies.
cocopuff,5,Excellent tablet for anyone,"I absolutely love this tablet. I check my e-mail. I watch movies. The only thing I DO NOT like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problems taking you to the correct site. But you must remember that it is a tablet, NOT an computer. I find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it has unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it takes just a few minutes. Amazon Prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movies and read books as almost everything available cost money. Prime is a money saver and it lasts a full year. It also comes with free shipping. I tried it and it is good. I receive my purchases in 2 days. Prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it comes with a lot of perks."
Lynaria1,5,Excellent quality for the price,These were purchased as Christmas presents for my grandchildren. However I did open the packages to be sure they were fully charged and updated. I was surprised at how fast the response time was and how easy they are to navigate. My grandchildren are going to love them!

juke,4,simple tablet,Easy to use. Great for someone who wants to play some games and use simple apps.
floridajerm,5,It's a great tablet for the price.,"I like the tablet. The only negative is that google apps don't work, but for the money, I don't really care that much. I mostly just use it to read"
Mini,4,My 2nd One,I like it for the price but did notice some flaws.
Challenger,4,Very easy to use,I bought this product since my wife purchasers a number of books from amazon. We also wanted easy access to our emails.
Beardoc,4,Nice to review my photos from mini sd card,"Nice to review photos on mini sd card but, disappointed that photos can't be downloaded to the hard drive. Better camera with ability to see what you are taking pictures rather than 3rd generation which only has only one camera lens."

philsurfs,4,Good overall product,Good small affordable tablet gets the job done very nice.

Quasimodo,2,No netflix support,Sadly no having netflix support is resulting in my last tablet purchase from Amazon.
Nk129,4,Great!,"I bought this tablet for my 19 year old nephew for Xmas. He's currently enrolled in his sophomore year in college. I figured he could use this for some homework, projects but also for fun. After taking out and playing with it a little bit, I bought another for my mom and my 13 year old niece!"
Reed,5,Efficient,"You get what you pay for with this product. There are better tablets, but this is a wonderful product for the low price."
Kyle07,5,Great tablet,Overall couldn't be more happier with the tablet works great for the price of it I would def recommend to my friends
Periwinkle,4,A good device for the price,"Overall, this is a decent tablet. Quite easy to set up. Takes a few minutes to run the updates, but you'll be up and running in 15 minutes or less,Build quality-- very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling. the back of the device is a plastic type material but overall nice."
BigTopher,4,"Its slow, but then again, it was $50.","So far I've had my Fire Tablet for over a month. Its my first tablet. The lack of the Googlke Play store means the Amazon apps are pretty limited, but I found avway around that. The front camera is grainy but acceptance while using Skype. Battery doesn't last long, and it seems to take hours to recharge. For a $50 first tablet, I suppose those are acceptable flaws. Feels robust in the hand, though the plastic casing reminds you of its materials if you hold it tight."
sissy,3,help's me at work,this is Great for reading books or doodling at work.
kstechie,4,good for price,"resolution a little low on the screen, but excellent tablet for the price"
Mommy3,5,Awesome Tablet,We bought this tablet for our son and there were a lot of free downloadable educational games and apps. Amazon also gave us $25 to purchase apps and ebooks!
Dooley,5,Great Gift For The Wife,I purchase this for my wife that she can use as an e-reader. You truly enjoys it. She takes it to her book club meetings and she uses it more than her iPad.
Bestdealguy,5,Love it!,I really enjoy reading much more. Especially like the rotate feature
Mike,4,Good product.,This tablet is a well made tablet. Be sure to get a sd card as the memory is not great. The Amazon underground with totally free games and apps is worth the purchase alone. You do not need Amazon Prime subscription service to enjoy this little tablet. Go on and purchase one for 50.00 you wont regret the purchase.
SurlesS,5,Great tablet for the price.,"This tablet is great for the price. We ended up purchasing 6 of them. It is great for the kids and is very functional. I think the price helped lower my stress level where the kids are concerned, but it is very sturdy. Would purchase again."
d246115,5,Awesome buy for the price!,"I purchased the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet for 49.99 and I have to admit for it being my first tablet, it works great and I have no complaints so far."
momma6,4,first time tablet,"I purchased this to read books and check out ebooks from the library. I love it and it's easy to use. This is in color and you can even play games on it. It's small enough to fit in my purse so while I'm at appointments I can read and if my son gets board, he can play games."
giftgiver,3,Great for a tablet for price,"For it's price point, this is a great little tablet. As long as your not looking for something to do everything, you'll be happy. This was given as a gift and the recipient was very happy with it."
mimi,4,"Christmas gift, not used at this time","I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for one of my grandchildren, so they won't get it until then. It hasn't even been opened at this time. Overall rating is based on product reviews."
LK24,4,fun for my mom,"this was a gift for my mom, she loves it!!! works great"
Andy,5,Amazing value for your dollar,little gem does so much for such an amazing price.
Lglegl99,5,Great for my needs when my laptop is down,"Works great, easy to carry. Covers my needs when traveling."
ymmot,3,Meets price expectations,"Meets expectations consistent with the price. I don't really use it for anything. It simply can't replace my iPad. Both the screen quality and battery life are poor relative to my iPad 4 from a few years ago, so I haven't found a use for this Kindle Fire. Generally it just feels cheap and the user interface not as clean as the iPad. I think it's value is consistent with the low price point."
MrsDavenport,5,Love it,I got it for my son he loves it very good for travel
SPONGEBOB22,5,Great tablet. Great price.,This is a nice tablet. It has a really good clear screen.
jdsam,5,Low price tablet,"Great for the price.. Good for gifting, if you don't want to spend too much :)"
Soliver,4,Great value,It amazes me that this tablet is less than fifty dollars. Is it going to replace an ipad? No but it's not meant to. It is great for watching hulu and net flix. Amazon underground is pretty amazing also. Well worth $50. If you are on the fence about it just buy it. You won't regret it at all.
Madskillsmike,5,Great for a tablet nooby,As a tablet noob this was the perfect tablet to start with simple to use and even simpler to understand. I like every thing about it now I want a larger screen.
iMax,4,Great for kids,Bought it for my nephew and he loved it. Great purchase
JayD,4,Great for price,"You get what you pay for, with that being said. For 50 bucks i'ts great. It's not super fast wont play heavy games. But, it will netflix and read books fine. Screen is plastic, not glass like most so it scratches VERY VERY easily."
Tango,5,Awesome,"Great for kids or adults. Can't beat the price for what this tablet can do. Just as good as the more expensive tables, just need to buy extra memory"
borikua323,5,amazing,great tablet for the size. will be giving this to the kids from santa this year.
TieFighter,4,Great for the price!,I have owned many tablets in the $250 and below range. This is great for the $. A bargain with lots of utility at only $50!
XboxOneGamer,5,Great price!!,This tablet is great for a kid or it is amazing in quality for $49.99
Jmstott87,5,Great Price,I bought two of these for my daughters. Works great for the kids and if they drop them and break your not out a huge chunk of money like you would be for an IPad.
deadman197,4,good tablet,Download is slow but after its on the tablet. It works great good buy
BBGUN,3,Decent for the price,"Works fine for a $50 basic tablet/reader. Other functions, not so great. Very entry level."
ManCaveTV,4,Starter tablet,This was purchased for my daughter. She absolutely loves this tablet. It's a perfect size for her. She has not stopped using it since we gave it to her. It's an excellent product to keep her busy and entertained. The graphics are awesome. The price we paid was well worth it. We will keep shopping at Best Buy
Mbrpcall,5,Super good,"All I need,Great table great screen works as it should."
Elle,5,Great Tablet!!!,An excellent tablet for such an affordable price!!!!
IsaG,3,Slow,"I bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles I purchased. I am disappointed. I like the price. The home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. I mostly use it for reading books, and so far I'm dissatisfied. It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy."
rjcb3,4,Excellent for the price,"Quite simple: it's a kindle fire tablet. It does exactly what it should do as a tablet attached to a reader. I like that I can send things from my desktop to my kindle. It streams well, and it works well with my Bluetooth keyboard. This is actually what convinced me to do a year of Prime. Next year we'll see how it goes if I renew, but so far so good. The lock screen shows a different advert, but that's not so bad...it's only a lock screen."
Aaguzma,3,Cute little tablet,Did what I needed it to do took back to get a bigger size
Ishah,5,Love it!,I bought it for my nieces and nephews and they loved it.
Vlad,3,"Works like it should, just not what I wanted","It works great, its just not quite what I wanted for my daughter."
taylor,5,What a steal!,"et me start by saying, please do not buy this tablet expecting it to be comparable to an Ipad or Samsung tablet. I think the people who expect that are the ones who are disappointed by its features.I personally love this tablet. I wanted a tablet so that I could read, check emails, watch shows ( Hulu, Netflix, AMC), shop online and do some web surfing. I am a pretty simple gal. I did not expect much when purchasing this tablet. I assumed the picture quality would be fairly poor, that it would load pretty slowly, and that I would be unable to download most of the apps I wanted. It wouldn't have bothered me, being that I believe you get what you pay for ( and I could not afford an Ipad or Samsung at the moment). Boy was I proven wrong.I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality from the moment I turned it on. I have had other tablets ( and paid about the same) with terrible picture quality. I actually love watching my shows on this tablet because it is as if I am watching them on my television.This tablet loads pretty darn quickly. I have never had an issue with it loading slowly or getting stuck.I have been able to download EVERY app that I wanted, except Instagram ( oh well, no biggie). And me being the Amazon freak that I am, I was happy to see Amazon apps pre-loaded onto the tablet ( shopping, music etc. ). Speaking of music, the sound quality is pretty great too!I am very very happy with this purchase, it really is a steal. I would buy another for sure."
Peaches,5,Good Product,No issues with the product. I am a satisfied customer.
NathanP87,5,Great for Kids,"I purchased this tablet for my young nephew to watch videos on the go. It was to replace his iPad mini. This tablet does everything that he was doing on the iPad, is easy to use, and only a fraction of the cost. The advertising on it is a bit annoying, but can not complain with the price."
Pandora,4,Easy tablets to use for Amazon lovers,It is easy to set up and easy to use. You can use it to watch videos from the Amazon Prime video or listen to music with the Amazon Prime music or read on the Kindle. Great value for everything you get.
arcila13,5,Kindle the best tablet for your bottom dollar,"This is my second Kindle tablet and I couldn't be any happier. I primarily use my tablet to read comics, they have the best comic reader on any device to read your CBZ files (ComicCat). Now that you can upgrade and add extra memory the 50 price tag can't be beat by rival companies. Great for the kids. If they break it it's not as bad as breaking say an IPAD at a minimum of 300.00 dollars."
Canyonsmom,5,Love it,My son bought this and he loves it. And it's cheap!
NickName,5,Awsome Tablet for the price!,"This little tablet is awsome for the price. Great for the kids too! Perfect for reading books, playing games, surfing the web. I am very pleased with my tablet! Will be buying more for gifts this holiday season!"
nshaik,5,You cant beat this price for an Amazon tablet,Best thing that has come out of Amazon factory for a long time $50 for a table and the underground app store makes it more worth than the price you pay. No complains.
Vcam,4,She loved it,Bought for my niece she loves it !! Easy to use and good size.
Scott,3,Amazon Free Time Ad machine,"My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me."
Donpc,3,Decent Quality,Better quality then most tablets in same price range. I still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it. Ads on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it functions like its supposed to.
debi,5,great for reading and for kids,Great value. My kids love it and use it often. Really helps them with homework.
Southernjack,5,Great tablet for a great price,This tablet is a great tablet for a great price. It meets your needs of a tablet -from Internet surfing to reading your favorite books.
nahmed7878,4,Great entry level tablet...,"You can't beat the price...Picked this one up for only $60 from Best Buy..I like the additional control parents have with kindles. It's great when you want to limit your kid's time on youtube, games etc. I would certainly recommend this to a friend.."
Hpanic22,5,Great for the price,I bought this tablet for my wife. The Google app store and 8 gigs of memory were just what she was looking for.
ShawJ,4,Good for my 10 yr old,I bought this for my 10 year old son so he could read books and of course play games. I bought a 16gb micro SD card to use with it because I knew the 8gb wouldn't be enough.My son loves it! He reads his books and plays all types of games. And thanks to the Amazon Underground app most of his games are free. While this tablet doesn't have enough power for me it is perfect for him!
tstroppels,5,Good for the price!!!,Good for the price hard to beat it!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!
Playwithit,4,Great purchase,Love it the size easy to carry and store would recommend to others

Skipper,4,Ok little tough stay away from the Amazon apps,App selection is very difficult too much Amazon sales have not been able to get my Reward Zone points tried to purchase app but was unsuccessful
Rena,5,Great tablet,It works well my granddaughter loves it she plays on it everyday
biglou8501,5,"Great tablet, specially for the price!",I love this tablet. It does a lot more then my previous one which cost almost 4 times the price.
Hollister76,4,Really great android tablet for the price!,"I love Amazon tablets. You got the best of Amazon and android apps in one device. And, for $50, you can't beat the value! I highly recommend purchasing this tablet."
jNet,4,Awesome tablet for the price,"I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by ""for iPhone"" and ""for Android"", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. Love, love, love my new Amazon Fire tablet!!!"
MsLady269,4,It's a $49 Amazon Fire.....,"So with that said, I cannot complain. I purchased this so I could have something inexpensive, small and could throw in my purse or pocket to read school books on the go. I own an iPad Air 2. I paid $450 for that, so it's not fair to compare the two.Of course Amazon doesn't have the apps that Apple has. If you're looking for something to read books on, but to be able to hop online from time to time on a screen bigger than a smartphone, this is it.The screen resolution isn't top of the line, the audio isn't great, but you can watch Amazon video, youtube and other streaming services on this table.If you know the capabilities of this tablet, then you won't have your expectations set too high. With that said, comparing this to any other $49 tablet, this wins. With the low-end cost of this, if I had the finances, I'd find an under privileged school district and buy these for them. The features of setting these up for educational time for kids is great. If you haven't already exposed your kid to iPads, I'd recommend one of these.I think the Fire would also be good for someone who isn't a techy. I don't even consider the camera on this. They could have left that off of the device, but I suppose if you purchase one of these for grandma, she can use it to skype the grandkids. I just see a lot of possibility for this because of the features and cost."
Connie,4,works as expected and the price was very reasonabl,I went to purchase a new tablet because I had misplaced my old one. I told the sales person in that department that I was interested in one of the cheaper tablets that you have on display and he asked me if I had ever owned a Kendal. I told him that I had purchased 2 of them previously and really liked them. He then told me that the newest Kendal had just been delivered 2 weeks previously and it was only $48.99. I said WOW that's a great price for a Kendal and of course that is what I purchased. The sales person was very polite and professional. I really enjoyed the experience.
Deejay,4,Great tablet for reading.,Friendly user for kids enjoyed being able to read books.
Jake249,4,Great! More than an e-reader.,"Looks good, works great and light enough to carry in your pocket. would be much better if it would a compaters (nook) APP."
Jonas,3,Slow disposable tablet,"If you don't mind the slow performance, it is a good tablet for the price."
Tero,5,perfect tablet for a child that loves to read,My 10 year old granddaughter loves to read. She can now download books from the local library as wall as other websites. This is a wonderful tool for a child that loves to read

moviegig,4,Good tablet,It's a really good tablet for the price. I was amazed! If you're on with the amazon app store(aka underground) then you'll love this tablet.
Kjatl,3,Sturdy & durable,"I would say this is great for kids, but the apps are very limited. There are only a few good free apps in the kindle store. The battery life is very poor. The volume is either loud or it can't be heard. It's hard to find a good middle ground. Overall it's still a good tablet for the price."
UncleAl,5,Excellent Value,This tablet replaces a tablet I've had for several years and I am very pleased with its flexibility and size. I'll expand it with apps as yet unknown. I expect it to fit in with my home network.
TXMomma,5,Great for kids!,We bought this for our 6 yr old kid. It is easy to use and the battery lasts for several hours.

MJFire,5,Better than expected,This cute little tablet has all the great features of an iPad mini plus more. Great for kids and adults!

hortencia,5,very easy to use great for all ages,I bought 3 of these. They are great and very durable . . The price is amazing .
J1080,4,Can't beat the price,"Works as any other kindle fire. Does have advertisements, but for $49, can't beat the price."
Penny,4,Really surprized & impressed by price & quality!,"I had 2 other tablets that worked terrible. It wouldn't even take e-books from the Library! But this is the perfect balance between an e-reader that could get boring to some people, & a tablet, that uses up the battery real quick. And you don't have to connect to a computer to download the e-books either, which is a real convenience!! So I would have to say this cute little tablet is really a lifesaver for a lot of really Poor people, that can't afford to buy expensive electronics. If they lose it, breaks. or gets stolen, they could easily just go buy a brand new one. The goal is to stay connected to the mainstream. It is easy to carry on the bus, bring to the park, maybe a classroom, or library, dining room, coffee shop. And not a big worry about losing a lot of $, if it got lost. Plus, with the ""Amazon Cloud"", You would never lose any of the e-books, that you paid for, & can use on all you devices. This should be considered a Gift-package from Amazon, especially for new people that never had a chance to own their very Tablet, & always have to run to the library, or borrow someone else's. Penny"
KARob,5,Good purchase,Very satisfied so far. Easy to use and great price
Camsmom55,5,Great product,Great product. This is my 2nd one. My first one was stolen. It is very user friendly.

Jefferson27,5,Great for readers,My daughter would not read before she got her kindle. She love this and now reads all the time. Books are cheaper and less space needed in your home. Great games.
tkirton,4,good device,I think it's good for a first tablet. i m use to the Ipad so this is taking some getting use to.
Andrew,5,Cheap and Awesome,"I got this because I saw it on Amazon.com. I the. Went to BB just to see if they had it in stock. I fooled with the demo for about a minute and decided it was good enough to spend the $50 on. If I didn't want it I could give it to my mom or something. This thing has really impressed me. I have an iPad and an iPhone 6s. The kindle isn't near the performance of those guys but I was looking to step outside my ecosystem and just get a feel for something new. Besides, Amazon can do no wrong. Bottom line is that it's a greater starter tablet...something to have on the nightstand and let the company use."
ntank1,5,best tablet... and not just because it's cheap!,"This tablet is incredibly inexpensive. I have an iPad mini, a windows tablet and another older Fire tablet and this newest version is one of the best tablets I have seen! It's quick, has a great screen and the battery is great. I bought this to take on a trip to SF and used it both ways on the plane to watch movies I had downloaded and used it over the weekend while I was there and didn't have to charge it the whole time. I like that they moved away from the carousel and just have the app icons listed the way they are now. I have recommended this to a lot of my friends, especially the ones with kids."
smile,5,it get great picture,I enjoy my fire tablet and I like it is HD picture
Dave,5,Outstanding product,"Outstanding product at a great price. I previously hand a Kindle reader and the 7"" Fire is a much improved product."
Moocowey,5,A great tablet,I purchased this as a gift for my great aunt. It's easy to use and light enough for her to carry around.

dwmajick,5,Great Christmas present,"My kids are always arguing about who gets to play on my iPad. This should eliminate the arguments, it's a good tablet that is expandable and for $50 you can't go wrong."
craftymom1863,4,"alot of tablet, little money","i play games, read books, watch movies, surf the web. love the expansion capability"
CauseImLucky,5,Does exactly what I wanted it to do.,"I got two Fires for the kids to tool around on while they're learning how to use a tablet and they are great. They're fast, HD, and have expandable storage."
redfire,5,Great tablet for kids!,This tablet is inexpensive and user friendly for my toddler. He loves it and uses great educational apps.
Harold,5,Great starter tablet,This tablet is fantastic for the price. It's as good or better than my first fire. The only differences are this one has only 8 gb's of storage but has front and rear cameras. It runs as fast as the other and the resolution is as good.
louise,5,great looking games and books also,games are excellent and great books to read as well
speedy71,4,"a great value, good tablet","I bought one of these for myself and another for my sister. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase, it's an overall good value. The OS is very clean and simple to navigate and based on android. I was able to install the Play store without rooting the device by simply installing the apks. Overall it works great with Amazon apps and those I've installed from the play store. The sound quality is fair though the one speaker is a little low at times. Screen quality is good, not HD but decent. The most lackluster part of the tablet is the front facing VGA and non-auto focus rear cam -- I was unable to scan some barcodes with the rear camera. However, at this price point you get a lot for your money. I especially like the amazon underground apps that are totally free and add to the value of the tablet."
AshT,2,Not many free apps,I needed this for my two six year olds to be able to use during our drive to Disney. You are unable to get most apps that are offered on iTunes and android market so I returned.
MrsAdams,5,Awesome,Bday gift for my 10 year old. He loves it! And the price was perfect.
dray33,5,great product,Works great. I bought this for my 7 year old after she broke her other kindle. It works just as good as her Kindle fire HD but it was way cheaper. There's not a lot of storage but for $50 I won't complain.
barney,5,Great value,"Great performance for the money, however if you are looking to read in bright sunlight it is not ideal."
Richard,5,You get a little more than you pay for this time!,"This tablet isn't the brightest, lightest, fastest, thinnest tablet on the market, but i have Amazon Prime and it allows me to shop, do a little gaming, watch videos and movies, listen to music, read books, and browse the internet. I mean really, what else do you do with a tablet. More that satisfied."
kindlefire,5,Great for the price,"Great item and great price. Use it mainly for books, but good enough for basic internet activity"
Bizzknocks,5,Great Tablet,"I would recommend this tablet , I bought a few other tablets for my younger kids same price , the orbo and wimo but unlike those.. This tablet runs super smooth, install all your xbmc's and kodi's .. Great screen very clear, picture seems better than my iphone 6s plus #shrugs"
TheKnight,4,Good for price,Great for price. Wish the Amazon App store had more apps. Overall good especially for prices.
Joel,5,Great for price,Great product for children at this price...makes good Christmas gift
Corndog,5,Amazing value!,"This 7 inch tablet exceeded my expectations and then some. I was apprehensive about having advertising on the wake-up screen, but with a simple swipe of the thumb it goes away with no waiting. It streams Netflix and UV copies from Flixster with zero lag and no buffering. Expandable memory, (Micro SD). This is basically an android tablet, so if you have experience using that platform, you will have no trouble navigating the settings menu, etc. There is no Google Play store access, however, the Amazon App store is available and is pretty impressive. The resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. One of my complaints with my old tablet was the visibilty when viewing at an angle, but this tablet does not have the same issue. All in all, this $50 tablet is the best value I have seen, as it outperforms the dual core $250 tablet I just replaced. If you are looking for a 7 inch tablet, you can NOT go wrong with this one."
DCR318,5,Excellent Value and Price,"This was for an employee appreciation event, the prize winner was very excited about winning the Amazon Fire!"
Avpfan,5,Pure Value,"I purchased this for my dad as his first tablet and he loves it. Technically, it's not a powerhouse but for the price it's the nicest little tablet you can get your hands on. It's perfect for a child, to use in the kitchen while cooking or kill time in the bathroom. Looks-wise it's pleasing and feels good in the hand."
melissa68,3,great color on tablet,don't care much for it you have to purchase any apps that r used on daily basis
hank,5,awesome tablet,love this. I didn't want anything super big or bulky. something simple for a few fun app games
scoutmaster,5,fun and easy to use,wanted for email/streaming video /audio great price
Rodney,3,Not For Previous Tablet Owners,This Tablet anonymous me so much simple apps like You Tube are a hassle to get and unless you know about .apk you are lost. Great for readers and simple web surfing. I do like the free games from underground. My unit arrived damage. Amazon replacing let's see how that goes.
ElRafa2814,4,Greatest deal out there.,"I use this tablet mostly for reading manga but I also enjoyed reading books on it. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I can't install all android apps in it. Other than than, it's light weight, compact, easy to use. I take it everywhere with me. Amazing deal for the price."
Sharoncryer3,5,Great tablet for a beginner,Love it! It's great for what I wanted to do with it.
PaulD123,4,Great Purchase,"I never thought I would buy a Kindle fire but I had purchased prime and discovered to be part of their lending library you have to use an Amazon product. Well, lucky for me Amazon had just released this 7"" Fire. I purchased it thinking the worst that could happen is I would be out $50.00. Well to my surprise the little tablet works very well. It is a perfect complement to the prime service and I have been very, very pleased. It is not a Samsung or an Ipad by no means but for what it can do it does it very well. I guess the best part to me like I said is it compliments the prime service beautifully. The O.S. system is almost flawless for watching Videos or reading books or the internet. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is not as good as the others overall but for $50.00 it is well worth it."
OKCReviewer,4,Amazon Fire 7 Tablet,This is a very good starter tablet. We have purchased several others that did not perform as well. The no-name brands do not have the clear display that this one does.
Jimstein,5,Awesome tablet for the price.,"Bought this tablet for my mom as a birthday day gift. She loves it. This is her first tablet and shes learning how to use it. I was very impressed with how quick and responsive it was. Also it has an excellent display and runs just like 200+ tablets, Will play all your favorite apps."
Nickname,5,Great purchase,This is a great product at a great price! They will make great first time tablets for kids.
EsmeS,4,Great tablet!!,Got this tablet for my 6 year old and she loved it. Easy to use.
cascadia,4,my first tablet,"I was a little concerned about the advertised display resolution, but it's good enough for my uses. It's not as sharp as a lot of the other tablets on the market, but it only cost $50. That makes it so I'm not so concerned if it gets broken or lost. I've watched some videos on it and the display seems fine. Mostly I use it to read e-mails and surf the web. As this is my first tablet, I'm still learning about its capabilities and limitations. I've taken only a few photos on it and it is not as sharp as a lot of other phone/tablet cameras, but still serviceable."
DeVo,4,Great tablet.,I like this tablet very much. For the price I couldn't ask for more. Very user friendly. Very kid friendly too.
hockettev,5,Great Fire for the money,"I love this tablet. It works very well. I bought it because I love to read ebooks and read the Bible app. Having a 7"" screen makes this easy.As far as apps go, it has Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and tumblr available. It does not have Instagram available in the app store. I knew that going into it, because I've owned kindle fire tablets in the past.This Fire is so lightweight, and I love that. One tablet I owned previously was almost too heavy for my purse.This tablet has a browser, called the Silk browser, and it works well, although I don't use it for that.When it comes to games, the appstore has most of all the popular ones like candy crush. Pandora is also available.This Fire is an excellent value for the money, and I truly mean that. Perfect for kids too"
dina,5,Great Tablet!!Downloading apps was easy!,"This is my first Tablet and I love it!!Easy to understand and there are so many apps I read a sample book and I like the huge selection of books,newspapers and magazines The lighting is perfect easy on the eyes"
Lucerog,5,Great tablet for the low price.,Highly recommend purchasing as a starter tablet and/or for a younger child. Internet access through Silk Browser and most common apps available through App Store.
Rami,5,Best Value for under $50.00,"Great tablet for the price especially if you are a Amazon Prime member, very pleased, makes a great gift."
zimnel91,4,Nice tablet for under $60.00,"The tablet works nice for reading and surfing the internet. It also has decent choice of games to download from Amazon. It also plays video decent, but the resolution on the screen on the screen is a little lacking, It is not an iPad Air, but as a basic tablet it functions well for the price."
Kingpin,5,Good cheep tablet,This is a really good device for those who want a cheep tablet
Bigbuff357,4,Amazon tablet,"Amazon tablet great gift, love the 6 pack gift idea"
gman,5,wonderful tablet for on the go!!!!!,I have a desktop at home but this will let me know whats going on at all times......
Eddie,5,Awesome tablet for in home use!,The price on this tablet is unbeatable. The performance is above what we expected. If you are looking for something to use at home then this is it.
diannek,5,Excellent device,Bought this Fire HD 7 for my son - he loves it!! I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.
TracyRNLA,4,Good tablet,"A little slow loading compared to my HDX which just had the screen broken, so needed a less expensive replacement. Great for reading books of course!"
Duck,5,Good tablet for school age children,Bought for my granddaughter.. She love it..got a great warrant also
mickey,4,great tab for price,Got this tab for my 3 year old daughter. Shes always on my phone or tablet so got her her very own. It has all the functions and apps she likes and uses not to hard to use and gets the job done for the right price. She is 3 so she will drop and be rough with the tablet seems sturdy enough and not expensive that it's going to break the bank if she damages it
dkcain,5,Good buy for the money,"This is my 3rd kindle and my 2nd kindle fire. I bought this fire because of the upgrade ability and my 1st fire didn't have that, Before I bought my 1st kindle, I compared all my choices and found this one to be the best for the money and I love my kindle so much I bought on for my daughter , It has a lot more then the original fire did, more Apps can be used, it connects to Goodreads, if you do that, which I do, and it has a camera. It's more like a tablet than just only a e-reader. A little different set up than the original fire but not that hard to get used to, buttons are bigger for the power and the volume, which is a plus."
thugtech,5,More useful and affordable than dirt.,This just a great tablet. A co_worker was saying that it is no as sophisticated as her $600 tablet and it isn't. But I can put one of these in every room in my house and still have money left over. This is one of the best $50 I ever spent.
Onih,5,Love on first sigth,"I purchase for test because cost less than $50, work awesome, faster, easy to use and good product by the price."
iamdaddyman,4,"Very pleased, priced right","I seem to enjoy this in most catagories. Wasn't sure about the tall and narrow screen layout at first with reading books, but when placed side by side with old ereader, no strain to learn new layout. Only thing not happy about is the lack of under $10 cases. Not wanting to spend $25 and up for a $49 unit. I'm sure that will change. This is a real good product in a usually subpar price point. I think this will be a game changer."
whitdawg,5,Excellent product,Purchased this tablet for my nephew and it's amazing.
Alex,4,Great value for the price,"I got this cheap tablet as a gift for a kid. They can play games, watch videos, and surf the web at a very reasonable price. The performance is pretty good for only a $50 tablet."
Tabtab1,4,Nice inexpensive tablet,I bought this tablet as a cheap replacement for my son's tablet that stopped working suddenly. It seems to work well and he says he likes it alot. I am considering getting one for myself.
bushmaster,4,"Inexpensive, very handy kindle/video tablet","Bought this because my old Galaxy Tab 10 has become old and slow. Very pleased with the Fire tablet, quickly loaded books, magazine subscriptions and easily taps into my Amazon Prime subscription - video and music. Only reason it gets 4 stars versus 5 is the annoying ad on the lock screen (although I'm sure that's why the device is so cheap)."
hk4414,5,the kids love it,"The kids love it, so I'm very happy. that's all that matters to me"
Snowgirl,4,Love it! :),"Really enjoying this baby kindle! My first experience with a Kindle product. Fits in my purse even in folio. Recommend a stylus. Having fun loading it up with books, videos, music, and apps. Use it for email and facebook, internet searches, etc. I don't have a smart phone so this is really handy. And, hey, it has TWO cameras, too!!! For $50--UNBELIEVABLE!!! At this price, I could have one in every room of my house!"
Regulators,4,great quality tablet,"Amazon tablets are a great quality, an a good price."
tabletowner,4,Good and inexpensive tablet,Great price for a decent tablet. Amazon hit it out the park with this tablet.
fenton,4,Good for first time users,I bought this tablet for my 9 year old sister as a birthday present. It is decent but not as good as other tablets on the market. I recommend it for first time users or light tablet users.
Kelly,5,Great buy!,"I've researched this tablet and the ""techies"" say it's a great tablet for the money. I bought it as a gift for my mother and I think it will be perfect for her. I'm going back to buy a few more for my kids."
Judy,4,"Great reader, okay tablet","The Fire replaces my Kindle reader and serves this purpose well. When using as a tablet with WIFI on, battery runs down very quickly but oh well just need to charge often. Really like the camera. Not the greatest pics but again serves my purposes well."
robwliny1,5,"For the price, unbeatable","This wasn't for me, but for a family member (I have a Kindle Fire HDX for self). They very much appreciate having this as a replacement for another tablet, seems to work better (less/no crashes, better battery) compared to the older one (not an amazon tablet). Side-loaded texture/next-issue as a way to get unlimited magazines (can access subscription on several devices) on this, and it works fine (usually, but once had to clear app data).This tablet is not as high-res as the HDX (so tiny text isn't as clear as it could be without zooming) but it's more than sharp enough for daily use, especially at this price range"
George,5,Excellent buy,I saw this item on Amazon if I had ordered it from them I would had to wait 30 days. Best Buy had it in stock for the same price. Having uses it for several weeks I found its a great small tablet for a great price. I plan to buy several more as stocking stuffer. For an entry level tablet you can't beat it.
AF16,5,Great tablet for the price,I am very impressed with the tablet. For the price it is great. Apps load up quick and look great on the tablet. The OS is easy to navigate.
Bloodember,5,Great little tablet for reading and light browsing,"I got this tablet to replace my kindle e-reader. I was not disappointed, it's a great tablet to read books and comic books on. Browsing the internet is ok on it, if that is what you want to do also. Basic games work great, but if you want to play extensive 3D games, you might want to get a different tablet, you can't expect a $50 tablet to run any of those. Overall, it's a great tablet for what I wanted it for."
Rod3,5,Great product,I preorder 4 for my kids and they love it. The use it to connect with families in Mexico. They use it for school as well when they need to use the web.
caroleeann,1,i do not like the fire,I do not like the layout. I want to remove stuff from the screen and can't . I don't like some of the lock out features like playing songs for the kids. i do not like all the advertisements. I don't like the screen doesn't go dark when i want it to such as when music is playing. I liked the samsung
Seemill1978,4,Perfect Reader for the price.,"This isn't going to replace a tablet or an ipad, but if you're looking for a great display to read books and magazines, you can't beat this for 50 bucks."
deatonfl,5,Enjoying my Amazon Fire tablet,I've had two other tablet before this one and gave both of them away due to shoddy performance. Finally decided to try the Amazon Fire after recommended by a friend and so far I love it!
Mattb,5,Great Media Consumption Tablet,You can't beat $50 for a usable media consumption tablet. Play games or watch video without pauses or skips.
John,5,You get a lot for $50,"Bought this at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. Short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and I kinda like Amazon's new OS running on this tablet better than Android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. As far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on Android) the apps have installed are Facebook,Linkedin, Overdrive, CNN, Pandora, Pinterest, Skpe all run fine. You can even run games on this $50 device, games like Sky Force, Real Racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. Videos on Netflix, HBO Now, Pluto Tv and Youtube look great even though they are not HD. Sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not IPS. Battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking Facebook, surf the web and gaming. Already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.I not a Prime Member but purchase a lot from Amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. This tablet has been rock solid for the week I have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. Was going to buy the Amazon Fire HD but since my last $270 Amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. Amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's I disagree with. Now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market (looking at you Apple Ipad and Samsung) then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task (just like your smartphone) then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you."
flakpup,4,Great value for the cost,An excellent tablet at a low cost. It more than met my expectations for basic use such as video watching and gaming.
zilch,4,"Purchased for my grandsons, they will enjoy it ver",I bought two of these for my grandchildren because they wanted one and the price was right. They used one before and are very familiar with it. They will love it.
kmld,5,Great for reading books,"It has everything I need, and is a great product at a low price!"
Jgsg,5,Great,"Nice, fast, easy i bought for my mom and she is very happy.!!!"
btf2015,5,good relation quality price,"the perfect gift, excellent price good device !!!!"
Rod1,5,Great high quality tablet,"A nice high quality tablet with a fast processor. Superb image quality, long battery life, and a great value. Equal quality and performance of an IPad at a fraction of the cost."
kctori,3,My first tablet,"I was in best buy having computer worked on, waiting I saw the Amazon fire 6, and saw the great price and bought it. I have been pleased with the features and user friendly."
MobileTrekker,5,"4-star tablet, 5-star value","Apples & oranges. They're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.When thinking about the new $50 7"" Fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a high-end Samsung or iPad Mini. It does a lot of the same things, but it's different. It costs a fraction of the cost. With that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. In fact, short of finding a nice, 2nd-tier Asus , LG, or Lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new Fire tablet.Prior to getting it, I had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. I have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. Amazon got this right. It is not as crisp as my older Kindle Fire HD 7"" or my Galaxy Note 8.0 or my iPad Mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. Worlds beyond most low-end/budget tablets I've tried (especially anything costing under $100 new). My daughter, who has been using a Kindle Fire HD 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.The new Fire OS operating system looks & feels much more like Android or iOS, which is nice overall. It still is not perfect, but overall I think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older Kindle Fire tablets.The 8GB of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microSD slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. What remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if/when the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. So far, this has not been a problem.The inclusion of both front- and rear-facing cameras is a nice bonus. No, you're not going to capture great shots. But both cameras are usable and add value.The speakers are OK. Volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use - and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch (or several notches).If you have $150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. If you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a high-end tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. I've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub-$100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. At its current price of $50, it's a no-brainer. Kudos to Amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets AND making quality tablets available to the masses."
BillyYank,4,"Don't hesitate, get one today!","Best bang for the buck! Although it may lack the processing power of the Ipad Mini, it has all the features and is 20% of the cost at $50.00. The battery lasts at least 5 hours of intense gameplay and video watching. I bought this primarily for my wife as a home entertainment device to replace her cell phone to watch video and check email, etc. She was not android savvy, but picked this up in a few days. I was very pleased to find it had Bluetooth! The built in speaker is what you would expect, small, mono and tinny. Although it isn't listed HD, at 7 inches an SD picture is razor sharp. Colors are bright, and the unit is light. Although you can't (without a hack- google it, wink wink) get google Play apps, the Amazon Underground has 10k FREE apps.You can also upgrade to 128 gb of external storage.Won't give it five stars as the sound without external speakers or headphones is weak, and the speaker is placed on the back, but would say 4.5 stars."
HonestTee,4,Great Tablet,Awesome only ga e four stars because in order to allow a child to use it you have to set a password/pin. And ecah time that child goes to use it they would need to enter it. Which would have been too much for the 5 yr old that I bought it for as a Christmas gift.
akidnamedkeeno,4,Works fine for my needs,"Excellent price, app store could be better but mainly using this for PBS Kids app for our son and Netflix when mobile."
heman777,5,great resolution,"It is one of the best 7"" tablet in the market, for the price"
DanChop,5,The best $50 I've ever spent.,"In the past I have avoided tablets at such a low price point, and while I was skeptical of this one as well it has been a great purchase. I use it for tasks I would normally do on my phone such as web browsing, streaming videos, reading, and Android games. It performs all of these tasks admirably. Battery is great as well. I can get up to 7-8 hours depending on the task at hand. It is small enough to always have with me (typing this review on it now), yet large enough to give that real tablet feel as opposed to my phone. I have already purchased another for a friend. At this price you cannot go wrong!"
Krissimoe,4,Great tablet for great price,Bought for my 4 yr old. ...great Tablet for his age. ..love the aps
Netexecutive15,5,Good tablet for kids,"I have several Amazon Kindles already. This was a nice, reasonable cost tablet for my little one. I have been quite happy with the Kindle devices."
CWOBillBrown,5,Better than the new one out!!,"Wife bought this as gift, she was going to buy the newest one but they recommended this one instead, good call!!"
Donova,5,Great product for the price,Great inexpensive product for the price. Just like the Kindle Fire HDX except for no mayday function. Both front and rear cameras are a plus. Love the Amazon kindle fire
radio2014,4,Good tablet but understand it's only a $50 tablet,"The new Amazon Fire tablet is surprisingly good, especially for the price. The performance is good, the size is good, and the weight is good. The biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot, which is something new for this generation of Fires.There are a few downside issues, however. First, the screen has splotchy illumination from the edge lighting. There are numerous light/hot spots around the edge, especially at the bottom where the menu bar is. After a while you get used to it, but compared to other higher priced tablets it's annoying.The software library is the second biggest issue. Amazon has done a decent job in adding new software, but it's app store is nowhere near as robust as the Google and Apple stores.The last issue I have is the 90 day warranty, but that is how they keep the cost down.Amazon developed the Fire tablet to sell other Amazon products, and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability. Web browsing is much better than my first Kindle Fire, and I think better than browsing on an iPad. The app that surprised me the most is the e-mail client, and how easy it is to use. In my opinion, it's a LOT better than the native e-mail client on the iPad, or a Windows tablet.If the build quality as good as a iPad or Samsung tablet? No, not even close, but for $50 it's pretty good device if you don't mind dots of light around the edge."
Qiatuaq,5,Kindle Fire,We got 2 kindle fires for our girls and we love them :) great purchase.
Draknus,4,Great Tablet; minor glitches,"The Fire works better than I expected. For a $50 tablet, I have to imagine it's the best on the market. Good battery life, fast response and loading times, nice display. The only problem I've had so far is that I have to restart it if I let it sit for over an hour before it will handle a wifi signal."
Jackie,3,Basic tablet,This is a good basic tablet bought it for my 4 year old. Only complaint is that it doesn't have one of the most popular games ( despicable me) which my son loves so he still have to use mine for that. Plz update software Amazon!
Nascarphillyfan,4,Nice Tablet,"Okay this tablet has its limits. It's not an IPad. But for 50 bucks it does a lot. If you have Amazon Prime it's awesome. If you don't, it's still nice. It's fast and has good battery life. You can side load apps if you can't find them in the Amazon App Store. Overall I'm impressed with the features."
qzblue,4,excellent for the price,This is great as a first tablet. It has Amazon underground for free apps. the only thing missing is no google play store:(
QueenKairo425,5,Awesome tablet!,"For $50 I couldn't ask for more! Aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, I can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos/ record videos (front & rear facing camera), check emails, and surf the web. Although you have to pay for most book/video purchases Amazon also offers Amazon Prime for a month free ($9.99 after) which makes some purchases less expensive. You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! The glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but I purchased an anti-glare screen protector to resolve that issue. With the holidays approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget! This would have been the perfect gift for me, had I not already purchased it for myself!"
Frank,4,Good if used as it is meant to be used,"I bought two of these for my children. They are not powerful, they do not have a bright screen, and the battery life is ok. But they are cheap options for kids to have tablets and helps keep down the fighting. App store is not good, but keeps kids entertained and that is why I bought these. Great value for the price."

SpedaleJr,3,Does the job,"Got 3 of them, great cost for what you get. My kids are down to only one left. Killed 2 of them sadly. Setting up can be a pain. Kids keep asking to add more apps. You have to delete the old to add more. I'm starting to dislike them more then the kids like them."
ARTnLA,4,Kids love it,"Bought for my 8yo twins. They love it. Games, camera, and videos. Easy to use."
Kittymomma,5,Great tablet,I purchased this tablet because it was so cheap! My husband loves it. It comes with many free games (games that you'd have to pay for if you had an iPad).

cdinprov,4,good for the price,"picked up a tablet because my laptop is over 3 years old, does a good job, sound levels are good, nice picture for a non hd product. Lots of pre installed apps and the ads on the sleep screen are annoying but for around 50 bucks not a bad product."
pvsgh,5,Best tablet you can get under $50,"This is the best tablet you can get under $50, I bought it for my daughter and she is quite happy with it. The last Kindle I bought was Kindle Fire 1st Gen Refurbished for $100 which doesn't have camera or mic. So it was definitely a good upgrade for a very low price."
Bigma,5,isGreat Tablet for children.,"The Fire Tablet is not only affordable, but a great piece of technology for choldren. The selection of books and games are very good."
neio,5,Simply Great,"This tablet is amazingly awesome. It looks like its price, cheap, $39 at #BestBuy but it does all that I need it to do which is streaming music and movies. You can setup multiple users including a child profile with parental control."
Angel,4,Great and inexpensive,Works great for a tablet and inexpensive. I got three in the past year and they all work great. I got them as gifts but I believe they don't have the same apps you can get through apple and Google play. You may want to check that out if you are using it for those apps.
clanknbang,3,Good for price,Good product for $50. External SD card is nice option.
Crom23,5,Great price but slow,If you have prime it's great for the money. Slow performance tho
RandallB,4,Good for price,Wanted a decent tablet for my teenage daughter without spending a lot. Other then the ads on the lock screen the tablet is perfect for her needs. You can remove the ads which to me is worth it.
OkJerry,2,Not a fan,The constant bombardment of ads when I turn on my tablet is not an experience that I enjoy. I would recommend you buy ANY other than one that runs the Fire OS. For the same price you can get a cheap android tablet and do a lot more with it.
DWAT,5,Very Nice Tablet,"Did multiple reviews before purchasing this tablet for my daughter. Very nice, works well and durable."
Lisa,4,It's ok for price,I have had some issues with this but not having a very helpful team to resolve issues.... I work and go to school I don't have time after time to beg and plead to get fixed...

jpchase,4,great for kids,"I have purchased this item to give as gift. It works great for kids. I only wish it had few build in apps that a child could start using right away. Anyhow, its great for kids, whether in us or anywhere in the world. I have definitely recommend this to all my friends and family."
gambit4,4,As always a good buy.,Just what you would expect from Amazon. Holds a charge well and does everything you would expect.
Teresa,3,Nice basic tablet for the low price,"Purchased this to mainly read books after my Nook died. Can't beat the price, but the print quality isn't as good as some other tablets. It's more like black on grey as oppose to crisp white. It can be a little difficult to read from versus the higher price tablets."
Paco1510,5,Great budget tablet,"Its a great tablet, mostly use for web browsing and book reading. Great value!"
will,5,Good tablet,I like this one because it is easy to operator and the battery last a long time.

ShortGuy1974,5,Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black,"This device is truly a great purchases for me, as I want something very small for a recent travel trip I went on. It made everything simple."
jdc1,1,Tons of advertising,"From the minute you turn it on there's advertising. The OS is very different from a standard tablet OS - I couldn't get an app that I wanted from the Google Play Store - it just wouldn't work on this. As I said before, I found the amount of advertising just ridiculous."
Diva,5,Great Buy!,Purchased this tablet for my 6 year old. Indeed it's user friendly with parental control.
christine,4,great tablet!!!,Awesome product. Got two of these for two kids! They really enjoy!
blessedwind,5,Great little tablet,"I bought the Amazon Fire for my granddaughter for her 8th birthday. She just loves it so much. She said it was the right size and everything. Truly excited her, Grandma gets an A+! I would like to add that the $49 price tag for this high quality tablet can't be beat."
nena,3,Great tablet for the price,The only thing that I didn't like was that I had to sign up with Amazon Prime in order for my son to get unlimited games. I ended up paying a little bit more.
BigAl,5,Bought 2 kindle fires,Great for my younger kids. My son is autistic. WTG
chgo4ever,5,Great Tablet for the Price!,I am extremely thrilled with my Amazon Fire Tablet. It is definitely worth its price!
Kcastro,4,Good for a budget,Its a fast and reliable tablet once you get past thw advertising. You can pay to have them removed but if you could afford that mights as well get the one without the advertising.
Hedwig,5,Great tablet,This purchase was a gift for 10 year old. Today's technology enhances the youth of today. This tablet is definitely a winner.

eyestallion,5,A fantastic tablet at an unbelievable price,"Perfect tablet not only for experienced users, but those that are not that tech savvy. My mother-in-law is really enjoying the ease of use of this tablet, it was a birthday gift. The quality of the build feels top notch. I need to get one of these to replace my aging tablet and utilize my Prime membership to it's potential."

Tricia,5,Love this product,Kids love being able to use this item as well! Very good for their little hands to use.
eigthbll,5,I love the kindle fire.,I love the kindle fire. This is my second-- I wore the first one out! I got it to read books and love that I can pack all my favorite books to go all in one small tablet! No more box of books to go camping! Also the larger print is easier on my eyes and if I fall asleep ot shuts itself off.
carol,5,Great tablet for me,"The tablet has been used for netflix a lot. I am an amazon prime member on a trial basis,so the uses for the tablet are numerous."
SharyC,5,More Than Just A Reader,"I bought this Amazon Fire to replace the one I had. My old one need to have the power button replaced and the cost to do that was more than what I paid for the new one. I like that I can take pictures (which I couldn't do with my old one) and it feels lighter. I can read my books, check my email and surf the web. The only negative thing is that I still haven't figure out how to print from it. It was a lot easier from the old one. I'm still exploring all the apps that are preloaded."
john1,4,great for reading books online,Love the size for reading and also for playing games online. Tablet is fast to respond.
Petey,5,Great for son,I purchased this product for my 8 yo for his birthday and it has been perfect!

32singer,5,Great tablet for a beginner,Love the ease to download apps and music. The size is perfect and it lights up pretty well
SciFiWriter2481,3,Decent $50 tablet/e-reader,"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. If you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings."
Appleuser,5,Good,"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. If you want to buy your kid a device, I recommend this one because it's cheap and if it breaks then it wouldn't put a big dent in your pocket to buy a new one or you won't feel bad for spending your money on it."
Rhonda,5,Great little device.,My son and granddaughter love them. Clear screen and game play is great.
keenapony,4,This is s nice little tablet to start out on,"The screen is adequate and the service is reliable. I did not play with it much due to it being a gift. Sadly the person it was purchased for was unable to hold onto it long enough to use it (elderly lady). I still have it though, and it's a great little backup to my primary tablet."
Worldshaker,5,Excellent! With an excellent price!,I bought one and recommended this product also to my family and friends!
Noctoynal,5,Works great,Got it as a gift for my son to replace his old kindle.
BobThePirate,5,Very Functional,Very happy with this purchase. For the price you can not go wrong. I mainly use for reading so I am sure for a techy geek this would not work.
2rainbows,4,Kindle Fire,This is a good little device. Well worth the money. Facebook is hard to read but overall a good product.
Trish,4,Overall,"Nothing is ever perfect. I'm sure my product has some flaws in it, which I'm okay with. As long as they don't effect the usage I'm happy. Sometimes takes a second to register me pushing the letters, but nothing too big."
Spankz,3,Overall good value but needs improvement,Initially I bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue I have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily I may have a defective unit which I may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better
Susa,5,Great device for child too young for an ipad,"Bought for my two grands to play games,etc. more affordable than an iPad for each."

TheB,4,"Good, cheap tablet. Charging port issues.","It's pretty good for the price! I bought mine for my kids to share and use.For this price, you may just want to buy one for each kid since mine tend to fight over it! The charging port on mine seems to not be working well (have to push it up to connect properly), but the kids tend to just rip the power cord out without any care. You may not have the same problem."
Allenavx,5,A steal !!!,This is the little tablet that could!!!The price is a steal and the speed and function deliver. Not a great camera but functional. Not great for skyping but that aside a real bargain!

FinallyBoughtTablet,5,Great Tablet for a beginner,"I bought this tablet to use while I'm on the go. I am retired and have used a desktop my whole life. I have tried the Apple IPAD but did not want to spend the money as I have a desktop @ home. So this works just fine for limited use. I use Google, surfing the internet when waiting for something away from home, etc. Keep myself entertained!"
jadzea,5,Nice little machine,"This is a nice little tablet for many purposes. You can browse the net, play games with friends, map out your trips, or find a nice cozy little corner and read a book."

Spinnersweb,5,Great Item,"This is a great tablet for a very reasonable cost. The only place the ads show is on the home screen, once you open to the operating system the ads are gone. If you just want to surf the web, or do some reading this is the device for you."
MaterialGuy,5,Great item. Really fantastic value for the price,"I had bought my girlfriend a Kindle Fire HD7 for Valentines day. She had never owned a tablet or PC before, and was just a beginner at smart phones. She became a reader gobbling up over 100 books in the last year. This lower cost device compares well in some ways, but the screen on her Fire HD7 is clearly superior. I would buy this again."

906shari,5,Great tablet for price,This is the 2nd one our family has. Perfect for kids games & watching videos.
julz,4,not bad for price,"this was the 2nd fire i bought for my daughter after the 1st i purchased at christmas stopped working after only a couple of months, the screen froze up and would not ever reset and couldnt be saved, she does use it everyday so i guess we got our moneys worth of use out of it for the 50 dollar price tag"
Cieneguita,5,keep impressing me,Well for a tablet of this price so compact and complete is not much to ask for than just your self to use it to the maximum capacity.I love this Kindell Best product ever.

tmnite,3,To complicated,Bought this for my 82 year old dad. It was to complicated for him to use. I couldn't figure enough of it out to be able to explain it all to him in the time I was visiting him. Returned and bought a different kind.
Jazzy,5,Best Value,Purchased this for my mother for Mother's day. It was very easy to set up and very easy for her to use. Great buy and value.
SunnyD,3,JUST OK,"So I love my electronics. I have an Ipad but when I saw this on sale I got myself one just to have since I am a prime member I figured I could use this too. The only thing I like about this is that you an expand the the storage. If the Ipad had that option it would be amazing. So since I then expanded the memory I can have more movies to watch offline. Camera is horrible, So I would say if you have a younger child, this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad."
AAAK,4,Excellent Peoduct,My son love this tab and I recommend this. This is a great product.
Monte6,5,awesome,"Awesome Price for a great tablet.Main use is for reading comics and internet browsing so there is nothing better i would ask for.good screen,easy set up"

JoeysMom,4,Great tablet for any age,"I bought this tablet for my soon to be 2 yr old. I wanted to download him some games and a couple apps to help him learn. He doesn't speak right now and uses sign language to communicate. This tablet works great. It's just his size, easy to use and paired with the soft foam carrying case I bought it from Amazon it's the best thing I've done for him lately. Would highly recommend for any and all ages."
Nat4,4,Great tablet for that price,I use it mostly for reading and it works well. I only wish that the camera was better but it is okay for that price.
BL17,1,Must have wi fi,I don't have wi fi. so I can't use the device. I'm returning it. I wanted something that my father could use as an e reader. I thought I would be able to download books via my computer using the usb cable. You can't do this unless you are registered. You cannot register unless you have wi fi. Amazon needs to fix this. This is a major flaw.
Cdeford27,5,Great cheap tablet,We love this thing! And for only $50! It works perfect for quick netflix
disapointed,1,REQUIRES BUYING many things including space,Didn't know you had to buy space and many other things for this item to work.
TRISH,5,REALLY easy to use!,"I was hesitant to get a tablet because I was unsure as to how it works and adding a new technology can sometimes be challenging. The Best Buy rep directed me to the Amazon Fire for it's ease of use and he was spot on. Also, the email ""introducing"" me to my tablet was invaluable and helped me immensely. A nice addition to the helpfulness of staff at your store."
Juanr,4,Great,Great price and easy to use.Wife loves it more than any other tablet.
Audiophile,5,Who would think cost only $50,"My wife likes to web-surf in bed and was using a 15"" notebook for years. Found it to be very cumbersome and was looking for an alternative. Tried out this Amazon Fire 7 figuring it would be adequate, but has exceeded expectations. Seems quick with good screen resolution. Only problem is doesn't always respond to finger or stylus swipe which seems common with most of these touch screens."
avidreader61,4,"For the price, a great buy",This reader is a great way at a low price to feed your newspaper habit. I save $50 per month on just one newspaper.
Rigo,5,Good price,Great device for children. Impressed by the specs.
cafelady40,5,Portability and Versatility,"I am enjoying my Kindle Fire. This is my third Kindle, but my first Kindle Fire. I really like the portability and the fact that in addition to books, the internet , checking my emails, I can also use it as a camera."

MrSincere,5,Great Buy,"I got this for my mother for mother's day, and so far, she absolutely loves it. It's fast, great resolution, and I've yet to hear of any battery issues from her. I picked this one for the reasons I just listed in addition to the access to Amazon Underground (FREE APPS that normally cost with Googly Play & Apple Stores, respectively).For those reasons, in addition to the price, you can't go wrong."
lilsnap,5,I Love my new Kindle Fire,Bought this after talking to a Best Buy employee & advising I had to return the Lenovo Idea Pad due to freezing up - he suggested I get the Kindle Fire - not too heavy to travel with & can do just about everything I need it to. I was so happy with it when it was on sale last week got one for my daughter & one for my boyfriend!
supashaq,3,Too small,"You get what you pay for. A small tablet, with OK specs. What was annoying about this tablet was the fact that you have to pay to remove ""offers."" You shouldn't have to pay to remove bloatware."

RazzleDazzle,4,Excellent Tablet,"I have the larger 8.9 hdx Kindle but find it cumbersome when going places. Plus sometimes I am places where I shouldn't necessarily have my kindle with me. I needed something small and concealable, just for reading books. This is PERFECT!!! I would have rated it 5 starts but two weeks after I bought the black one they introduced a purple one. GRRRRR!!!"
Vena,4,Good size,It's a great devise for and older generation women and she loves it
greg,4,great for the price,"the new kindle fires are amazingly good, the only thing that I have to say is the battery life is bad in it. other than that it is well worth it."
Jimbo87,4,Good value,"Overall, this 7"" tablet perfoms well. It's not the fastest, brightest, or thinnest on the market. But for $50 it is an great value. It doesn't come with the Google Playstore pre installed it can be easily added."

Jeremey,5,Great product,I do a lot of reading and it's just right for that
VonDoken,5,Great tablet,"I had the Fire model befor this one & it was ok, but way too locked down. This one is basically an Android tablet, with some key features added for Amazon. Little too baby for reading though, prefer my Paper White for that. But, great tablet for surfing, games, and movies/YouTube. The ONLY downside, won't connect over 5ghz (Wireless-N), stuck on the 2.5ghz connections."

Hawk,5,Great for kids,"This is great for kids. Don't necessarily need to buy the more expensive kids version for a protective bumper. You can get the same apps & a better price tag. Just watch the charger port, kids can bend it if not careful."

Wmercado,5,RE: States consider allowing kids to learn coding,Excellent product I use it for my kids all the time is great
MASm,4,Excellent tablet!,"Love the tablet, my 4 year old uses the tablet on a daily basis! Perfect tablet for kids!"
hockeycanuckjc,5,The quality is surprising,"When I first heard that Amazon had released a budget tablet, I was skeptical on the price that quality would be sacraficed. Boy did I have the wrong assumption, this product has exceeded my expectations and then some. The screen is responsive, the animation on screen is silky smooth when you zoom in on a picture or scroll up and down, it's just all out impressive. Front facing camera too is kind of cool although the quality is not as good as the camera that is in the back. Games play fine on this but you'll be wanting a memory card to store games on it. Games play fine depending on what you install on it but some games suffer minor framerate issues if too much is happening on the screen. Okay for the price, and this should be looked at before purchasing some of the other budget tablets."
Tsuerupe,5,My Son LOVES It!,Great product for the price no known issues at the time!
Campmomof3,5,Great product for great price,"This is my 3rd Kindle. I absolutely love it. The best feature I have found on it is the ""BlueShade"" option, which changes the light levels for when reading at night. Also you cannot beat the price. May be purchasing another one for my son in the near future!"
jproach81,4,Good stuff,Got the Amazon fire tablet for my daughter n she loves it. It had some good games n learning stuff on it n she needs that at the age of 4.
SalmsGrilnek,4,It's a DEAL for the price,"Still exploring the possibilities. I bought it as a ""sort of"" addition to my Kindle e-reader. Since I am not a total subscriber to the ""connected lifestyle"" I will be exploring capabilities slowly. My only complaint is the battery life is not (by a factor of (at least) 50) as good as on my KIndle e-reader."
Connie,4,Great tablet.,"The downside is everytime I open up the tablet, there is an advertisement. I would prefer not to see these. Font is changeable, brightness is adjustable."

BeanTea,5,Great eBook reader around the house & free WiFi,"This is a great eBook reader around the house & free WiFi areas ( some McDs, Starbucks, etc. ).Got this as: 1. It's 50 Bucks.2. Doesn't hurt so much if you fall asleep while reading ( doesn't weigh as much as a ""full-size"" tablet ) 3. Fits in my pants pocket so you can take it with you.4. Lots of free books from Amazon.5. Did I mention it's $50.00?"
Tawnymom,5,This is awesome for reading books on the go!,I would love to get one for my Dad for Father's Day!
Misty,5,Great value for the price,I was really impressed by this tablet compared to the price. It's not the fastest but it gets the job done and a convenient size. I allow my daughter to use this when doing research for homework. It's basically enough so she doesn't get sidetracked and it's advanced enough for me to complete my more advanced tasks. Great value for the price.
Kenny,5,Great value,"Bought this as a giftt for my wife. She uses it mainly as a method of reading books and loves it. The memory is more than sufficient for normal usage and is expandable if needed. The fact that it is not HD does not matter to her but if you use it to watch a lot of movies, you might want to spend the extra $100 bucks and get the HD. JShe does watch Netflix on it but usually watches movies on our big screen television. Great buy for the money. She loves hers"

Trav36,4,Great beginner tablet for an excellent price,This tablet is very well made and well worth the price. Amazon has a great market place and the tablet has a nice clear picture and the touch screen functions very well. Got it for my 3 year old son and he loves it plus I like that it has parental controls so I can block out things I don't want him accessing...
Mycreation64,5,A great tablet for a good price,Whenever I see an item in the store and the price seem a bit cheap I begin to get very cautious. I ask many questions of other users. Thankfully after having bought this kindle for my nephew he and I have been elated ever since .
Giantsfootball,5,Awesome,Picture is great & for the price it's more than I expected my son loves it.
Chip,5,Good Tablet,Great for young children and beginners. Has all the basic features needed to enjoy this tablet
IMMaGeek,5,Love it!,"It was a toss up between this, the Fire, or the Paperwhite. I wanted something small, mainly for using w/Kindle; a color screen, expandable storage & wiFi capabilities. Helllo! It was very inexpensive & the perfect size! Great battery life!"
Wezg,5,Perfect,"Got this for my nieces, they use it daily! Works great with decent specs all around."

StarTechie,5,Excellent Product,"The Amazon fire is a perfect size for viewing videos, reading books and playing games. Small enough to fit in a bag or purse."
Beretta,5,Great tablet for a young child,The only thing I don't like is the power plug it sometimes don't want to charge
jagervice,2,Not really kids friendly,Bought the tablets for my kids. The tablet isn't really friendly for them. The home pages try to take you to amazon stuff only and when they download games it's kind of hard to find them. Battery life can't hold up to a 5yr old. He runs it dead quicker then it can charge.
Dae85,5,Perfect,I need tablets that were cheap but had the processing speed that I needed to run certain apps. My children actually use them (I bought two because they were so cheap) and I have yet to have any problems. I love the individual profiles... Initally I didn't have any parental setting on there but my son quickly started purchasing books and such that he liked with my money.... Hence the individual profiles and limited access and a password on my profile. I'd recommend this product because of the price and functionality of the product. I love it and my kids do too.
MojoMom,5,All you could want in a tablet!,I'm very happy i chose the amazon fire tablet. It's easy to use and i easily got the apps i needed.
brazogitano,5,great tablet.,"I purchased this tablet thinking it will fill a void when my previous tablet was stolen, and it has done much more than i expected for it has apps no play store has, and amazon keeps me posted on any updated apps available for download through my email. I could not have purchased a better device for the price."
Titan25,3,It was decent,"When i first got the tablet the screen was damaged, overall it's a decent tablet. Its sorta slow, at the end of the day all i gotta say is only bruisers remain."
Kmizell,4,Good for watching movies & shows,I do love my Amazon tablet. Wish they had some apps that google play and apple have like kidstub. But other than that great tablet...
HBBW,4,Good tablet for a beginner,I like the overall tablet. What I don't like is the constant ads that pop up because they want you to purchase whatever app you're using. Kind of annoying.
tony,4,great value for money,This is a great product. Easy to navigate and use with Wifi.
froning,4,easy to use the kids love them and they are afford,This is the second one we have purchased and we really enjoy it.
Brad,5,Allego good,It was a great purchase and I love the way it works
Kendra713,2,Not too happy with this Amazon Fire tablet.,"I wanted a small tablet to read news and watch videos. I have Amazon Prime, so I figured why not, it is really cheap. Well, I believe you get what you pay for. This fire tablet froze on me, when I only had one thing open. I am very disappointed. It also is very slow when you rotate the screen. Ugh! I will be returning it."
Db91,5,AMAZON TAB,THIS ITEMS IS READING USING IT FOR READING AND LITE SURFING

BStout,4,Solid Purchase,Just using this for music so it does what I need it to do. Would give 5 stars but it falls asleep faster than I would like it to.
Fyfec,5,Great Tablet,I got this tablet for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it
Mouse,4,Good little device for a quick email check.,I chose this to check email and Facebook because I don't have a smartphone. It's a lot quicker than getting on my laptop. I use it for YouTube and Pandora also. My only complaint is my old eyes struggle with the smaller print. I am pleased with it!
Storm,4,My first ereader,"So far I like it, but wish the App Store had the game I play. I haven't done anything else but read so can't comment on other things."
2356,5,Great tablet for college student,This tablet is great for using ebooks as a college student
Hgaynor,4,Great starter tablet,"I bought this for my daughter for her 16th birthday and she likes it to ware her mind down at night. She made the comment that it great with the exception that its a bit slow, other than that it suits her needs."
PattyL,1,Understand Warranty before throwing out $50,"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????"
kathmer,5,WOW!,"Oh how I love this product. I spend hours playing solitaire, reading novels, listening to music all provided by my new Kindle Fire! I traded in my old Kindle which I also loved but this new one is a little larger and has more features many of which I haven't used yet. I couldn't be more pleased!"
jdzoe,4,great for reading,easy to use - easy to hold while reading lighter than my first kindell
Tori,3,Good,It's great! The price is right. You can load lots of books and cloud is unlimited to keep your books
KiloJ,4,Great entry level tablet,Bought 2 of these so far and they work great for the price. Buy a mini SD card with it because it only has 8GB onboard. This tablet is a good buy for your kids and you can enable parental controls if you choose to do so. I would recommend this tablet as a good buy. It's not the fastest thing around but it gets the job done. At 50 dollars you can break it and not care lol.
SgtKool,4,Great for a little reader.,This reader is great for consuming your digital media on the go. With a few tweaks it is quite a function tablet for cheap.
00worm,4,tablet for my daughter,Great tablet for the price. Surfs Web well.great for her to watch netflix on

Chell,5,Great tablet for kids,I bought kindles for my twins last November and I loved this product so much that I purchased them for my triplets for their birthday.
Shopalicious,5,Nice,I basically just brought it for my child to play with. I didn't want to pay a lot of money for a tablet so this was the way to go.

gzyp,5,Great for kids,"Great small tablet for kids. Very User friendly, because ugly several to use as give away items for kids ministry."
hjckicks,5,Perfect for the kids.,I have bought 8 of these. They are perfect for kids
Karri,5,Awesome product!,I bought this for my 2.5 year old autistic son. We have downloaded all kinds of sensory apps and learning apps. It's such a wonderful tablet to take on the go as well as for home use!
Olmanots,5,Great for Amazon Prime members only,As an Amazon Prime media consumption device it can not be beat for the price. If you are not a Prime member don't bother. Put the fifty bucks toward an iPad which can't be topped for a media device.
Terri,4,Great Tablet,"This is a great tablet, and the price was amazing!"
Dawn,4,Great for my son.,"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He knows how to work everything."

Awkaboole,5,The kindle fire is amazing and cool,The best part of the kindle is a lot of the games are free.
Mamawa,5,Great tablet for Amazon fans,"This is my second Kindle Fire, and this is a great improvement from my 1st generation version. With micro sd capabilities, I can download and store so much more. Paired with Amazon Prime and I'm never bored!"
Guest71,5,Love it!,This product is not just for reading books. It works just like a tablet.
Mamapajama,5,Great value,"I have bought 2 of these, one for my 4 yr old and one for my 6 yr old. Both of them have previously broken tablets before. I am amazed how well these have stood up to them and how well they perform. A super deal for a tablet. I likely will buy another just for reading for myself since they're smaller and lighter and easier price wise to replace than my iPad. Just a forewarning, the kindle store can be a little wonky and less streamlined in aligning purchases. I wish there was a restore purchases button like in the Apple Store since I've bought stuff in games to have the content disappear... I'm sure if I were less lazy I could call customer support though :)"
CfromtheD,5,Great product,Easy to use and update. Great for kids and adults alike.
CRMII,5,Great for kids,Bought two for my kids they love them. Great for the price.
YourFriendlyConsumer,4,Well built!,I bought one of these for my father. He loves it and I noticed it is very well built like if it was built the same way as the Amazon Fire box which I am very impressed by how well built it is. Even the battery terminals are polished chrome tabs. I mean come on what company goes to that much trouble. The charger reminded be of an I-phone charger. Impressed by this little tablet I will have to pick one up for myself now in the near future. Good product for the buck!
BmoreBob,3,Affordable reader tablet,Pad 50 bucks for this tablet and have been happy with it used a an internet reader. Can play video with some lag and buffering
Fire7,4,Nice tablet for children,"Good tablet at affordable price, I would recommend for kids or only browsing"
Jemmstar,5,Love this tablet,"I have a Fire HDX from several years ago and this one is so much better. The speed is great and the resolution is fantastic. I wish it had a bigger screen but for the price, what more could one want. I like the power and volume switches placemnt so much better than the HDX."
Psionide,4,"Battery life, compute power and price",We picked these up to help people register to vote at events. They have proven to be durable with a respectable battery life and enough compute power to do the work without lag and annoyance. The size is perfect for voter registration drives or other community out reach.
Jessica,3,Good,Kindle is nice for road trips to watch movies. Good battery life. It's cool.
Slizzie,4,Good product,This is a good product for the price easy for kids to use
busydeb,4,"Inexpensive Tablet, Works Great","I bought this primarily for reading books and it is just the right size. Easy to figure out how to use once you figure out the various tabs at the top that scroll (Apps, books, etc)."
Link,5,Nice pad for the price,Got this for my son. It's not top quality but for $50 it's not bad
Elmo,5,Awesome for the $$,"If you are looking for a reader that is just a bit more than a reader this is the right product. I bought this for my wife so she would stop trying to read on her small phone, and she absolutely loves it. Battery life is good, build quality is great, for the price there is really no comparison."
agirlCharlie,5,Can't beat the price,"My daughter bought a Kindle Fire when it cost $200 and thought it was a good deal for something that did so much. Mine was only $50 at my local Best Buy, and it's truly a marvel -- I can watch TV and movies from my library, read books and emails, and order products. I can't imagine any more for any less. Clear, bright colors, crisp lettering, although small (I bought the 7-inch screen)."
lacymae,5,Amazon Fire,I love my Amazon Fire Tablet so much that I purchased one for all my kids and my 78 year old mother as well. She has never used a tablet and it was easy enough for her to figure out and she uses it everyday!
nexradchris,5,good tablet for the price,This tablet is the best I have seen for $50. The screen is very readable which is more than I can say for anything else at this price.
Shawn,5,Tablet,Got this for my daughter and she loves it. I also use it as a e-reader
Bobby,4,Decent for the price,"I picked up the tablet Black Friday, intending it as a gift for my daughter. I knew beforehand that it had a crippled Android OS. I also knew that it wouldn't be top of the line for the price paid. However, for a sub hundred dollar tablet it is pretty good... After a little tweaking ( custom ROM with a few kernel adjustments)"
AARON39,5,Great tablet for the price,"This was a great price for a entry level tablet, It can do all the things I need it to well like Netflix and checking the weather."

Johnson,4,Great tablet,I like how cheap this is. It's great for browsing the Internet.
MelO,4,Nice,"I had a Kindle Fire HD 6"" but felt it was too small a screen and too heavy for how small it was. The Kindle Fire 7"" is perfect for me. I don't watch movies or videos so not having HD doesn't bother me. I am enjoying this one more."
Susan,4,Good for Reading,I bought this to replace my Kindle touch. Since Kindle's no longer have speaker options. It's good for reading but to small to be used as a primary tool.
natedog,5,great product for price,For the price this is a great tablet. I've had the Fire HD6 with a better screen but the 7 has a SD slot for more memory. Screen resolution between the two is very similar while viewing movies and tv.

Queenie,5,Excellent tiny tablet for the price!,"The Amazon Fire - 7 tablet is a terrific tiny tablet for the awesome price of $50. I can easily access the Internet wherever there is free WiFi.

Tonyrome,3,it's just ok for a tablet,"it's just ok for a tablet, it doesn't have google play store of course which limits a wide variety. I would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope. It's slow and browser doesn't load pages with flash or graphics good. poor camera. but it functions ok for a cheap tablet. i didn't expect a lot, but did expect better from kindle."

Linda,5,Great tablet.,I really like my kindle. I do wish it had so that you could move books that you had read to another area or just mark them as read. I read a lot and sometimes forget if I read the book. It holds so many books and I can take them all anywhere.
donfield,5,Great tablet for first time user,This was a gift for a senior citizen that is not a fan of computers and technology. After just a few minutes of instruction she picked right up on how much fun she could have with her down loaded games and she also learned how to reach out on the internet for information on subjects that interest her.

Bernie,5,Fantastic Value,"Used to replace my wife's kindle classic that she loved to read books with.Had several Android tablets she tried to use, but they were too slow or responded incorrectly.

estel,4,Great tablet for my granddaughter.,"My granddaughter loves to play games on this tablet. At the same time she can look for information on internet for her school homework. Another think I like about it, is that you can use an sd card for extra storage. It's very user friendly!"
Dwbiasi,3,Disappointed,I bought the Amazon Fire thinking it was all that and it is as long as I am home with a strong wifi. It does not pick up wifi good the connection is very weak when I try to connect elsewhere like I have to be right near the box or it doesn't pick up. But I find that with my camera also an Amazon product. Ok so that may be the problem.

poppop56,4,Good basic tablet,Good tablet for my wife to use for social media and looking up items for remodeling our house.
Chris0972,4,$50 tablet?,I spend more money taking my family out to dinner for a night than I spent on this wonderful little thing. I picked up a rubber guard and screen protector from another big box retailer and have a perfect tablet for my two-year-old for less than 70 bucks. This tablet has a kids profile mode which makes it perfect for your little one but also all the apps and great Amazon accessibility for the adults. I took a star off for the tiny amount of internal memory which gets used up extremely quickly so I would definitely recommend a micro SD card and making sure you change the settings to store your apps on the card and not be internal memory. Otherwise no complaints and several places on the Internet will tell you how to use another big-name App Store to download your favorites.
Cookie,4,Does the trick for simple things,"my 3 year old loves her kindle, Netflix and an abundance of games for her to learn from. Exceptionally easy to set up and use"

Keys2Love,5,The Fire that's cool to touch!,I went from a Paper white to the Kindle Fire and it's been great! It's easy to use and to read my books. Lots of stuff you can do with this from watching movies to taking care of my email and Facebook etc. All round easy to handle and is a nice computer tablet in the palm of my hands. I like the way the controls are at the top so I don't accidentally turn the power off in the middle of something when I was using other devices that had the on off button at the bottom. I just wish the power reserve would last as long as my Kindle Paper White. The battery runs down fester than I'd like.
chele,5,I can read downloaded books without being on WiFi.,I love that there is a free writing app that resembles Word and I can type documents which can be saved to Dropbox directly from the app.
Pcrepairs956,4,Great tabelt for the price,It does everything any other tablet will do. You can't beat the price. The only bad thing is the camera it's as sharp and clear. The pictures come out kinda of dull. But other that great little tablet make sure you get more memory.

Jonkjo123,3,Slightly slow. But good for the price.,"Slightly slow. However, really good for the price. Also... these Amazon tablets don't use the normal google app store... they use the Amazon app store, which is not as extensive as the Google App store. This can be a significant drawback."

RogueBlackheart,5,I LOVE this Fire,"Been reading reviews for months. I decided to take a chance when I saw this on sale for $10 off and I am glad I did. I love to read and reading is easy and relaxing, I dont have to worry about losing my place and Amazon always offers up the next book in the series so I can continue reading with very little interruption. I know that some have complained about missing pixels on the screen, mine was just fine, maybe they have conquered the pixel problem. Highly recommended."

Lillin,4,Great price,"I needed a tablet to play games, watch movies and so on while traveling. I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This tablet meets my expectations."
flagatorfan,4,Good tablet. Affordable.,"This is what it has come to. You can now buy a quality tablet for $50. Amazing! Works well, just couple things. It uses amazon app store, not, Google play store. It runs an OS called Fire 5.0, which is based on android OS. So you may not find apps that are available the same as android. Of course, all of the big name apps are there. But if you want to hold a good quality piece of hardware in your hands for not a lot of money, this is a great choice. Amazon has a philosophy. They want to make money AFTER the sale. So that's why they get you in at a low price. Also, they have created a revenue stream by selling ads. When your screen times out, it will post a ""screen saver/wallpaper"" that is an advertisement. If you want, you can go to your amazon account, pay a one time $15 fee (per unit, not per account) to get rid of them,"

wicalvin,4,Go to tablet,You can absolutely not beat a Kindle fire. Unless you are my 7 year old son. Haha. But seriously at the price and the beatings they take they are worth it every time and with the cloud storage I don't even mind having to replace it every year.

jtb9265,5,Great inexpensive tablet.,"I bought the Amazon Fire with realistic expectations. I have an iPhone SE (outstanding phone), so the intention was to be able to play some free games, view Facebook/etc on a slightly larger screen, some light web browsing, and maybe read an electronic book here and there. It has served this purpose with excellence so far. Not the fastest tablet you'll ever find I'm sure, but no slowpoke either. And I would venture to say you will be hard-pressed to find a better value for any piece of electronics at $50. Highly recommended."
Dannygirllovesu,5,Awesome tablet,"This tablet is excellent when you are an on-the-go person. You not only have the ability to access the internet, but you have the ability to read a good book as well. You will not have to lug a big book with you if you’re out and about.

SCMc,3,Great Tablet,Great tablet but after about a year it starts acting up and you cannot get help from Amazon to fix it.
Cowboy2020,4,Must have for Prime Account Members,"If you have an Amazon Prime account, you should have a fire tablet. It is so easy to have Kindle books, Amazon music and videos at your finger tips. This is $34 or however much I paid well spent. Now, what I don't like about the tablet is the operating system; it is limiting. Bottomline is if you need to do something other than use the Amazon suite of features you will need another tablet. However, I have no problem with using this specifically for the Amazon stuff and for managing my echo dot."

Jawz,4,Get more from the bargain,"I didn't expect to receive a premium tablet, but with this device it's great. I got more than I bargained for great job Amazon"
Sacst20,5,Excellent tablet for inexpensive price,This was a great price for a great tablet on Black Friday
MonmouthDrummer,5,Impressed,"For an inexpensive Black Friday special, I have to say that I am quite impressed with this tablet. Well worth the $33 price tag. The speakers leave a lot to be desired, but when used with an external speaker, it sounds great. The battery life is also impressive. I've been using it for 2 hours and the battery level is now at 54% remaining. I must admit that I was somewhat hesitant to purchase it, but I figured that for the price, I would give it a try. I am not sorry for my decision. I have another tablet that cost 5 times as much and there is no difference in the performance. Even at the everyday price of $49, this tablet is worth the money."
iceblueyez,4,Good Price,This was bought for toys for tots. Everyone always buys for the younger kids but forget that here are pre-teens and teenagers too!
Steveomatic69,5,I bought two of these for the twins,"I picked up two of these for the twins and they love em' I have to take them away from them sometimes, schoolwork has to come first ! Great tablet gave it 5 STARS, and at 50 bucks you cant beat it !"
PrimeTime,4,"So good, for the price","It's not a $300 Samsung tablet. It's a $35-50 tablet, depending on the deal. But this thing packs so much entertainment (especially with a Prime membership) that it's hard to go wrong with the almost-disposable price."

Jareth,5,Best tablet for the price.,"I bought this on Black Friday for my wife and she loves it. It's build quality is good and doesn't feel cheap, it has a decent front and back camera, the interface is easy to use, and there's plenty of games/apps to add hours of entertainment. I feel like the screen clarity could be better but for the price; you can't complain. :)"

Logster,5,Works great!,Our son is loving his tablet. Perfect size and cost.
Meche,3,OK beginner tablet,"I'm ambivalent about this tablet. It's a great price point and the picture quality is amazing. It's great for watching Netflix. But, you are locked in to only the apps available on Amazon. I can't download my browser if choice or even the google search app. Additionally, the tablet is linked to Amazon, and basically unusable if you don't have a valid Amazon account, I bought an additional tablet for a non Amazon person and they couldn't download any apps."

Leevid,5,Amazon Fire,"For what I need, this unit works great. I use it mostly to catch up on reading and looking at photos that I load via MicroSD card. Great resolution."
Roxxitas,5,mother day present,Cheap tablet for someone that knows little about the internet.
molly,5,A lot or your money,I have one of these tablets so it was a no-brainer when it came to purchasing one for a friend's birthday. This tablet is small and delivers a multitude of functions.
Bonge,5,Fire is Great,"Purchased this as a gift for a Senior, very simple to use for her needs."
LJBuy,4,Great budget tablet,I purchased the fire 7 almost one year ago. It is a very good tablet for the money. Screen resolution isn't the best but is adequate. But at this price point I am not complaining. WiFi seems to have slowed a bit since when it was new and I dont have many apps and I do clear the background tasks. That being said it is faster than my previous fire HD 2012 generation. Cameras are so so but I don't use them often if at all. Having the micro SD slot is great. Amazon does a great job of automatically up dating the OS. I just received the Alexa update yesterday. Pick this tablet up on Black Friday oor an even better deal!
reviewit,1,Amazon should bring back the HDX tablets,"Ouch. I bought this Fire tablet, and used it for about four hours, and left it on a charger. A couple of hours later, I picked up the tablet, and the screen was showing a weird 'ghosting' effect, and then the screen went completely black.I twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again, just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet.I'm sure I had a defective/damaged tablet, but I was underwhelmed with the quality, and it would be nice if Amazon brought back the higher quality HDX tablets, for people who don't mind paying more for quality tablets."
Greeneyes,5,great tablet,I love it. Works great for what I purchased it for
etexas,4,Cost less then replacing cracked screen,My special needs son frequently drops his tablet. This is a great low cost option when no protection case can hold him back.
KYW1,5,Best value for the money.,"Was about to purchase another tablet for more money else where when another shopper informed me of the Kindle Fire being available at Best Buys for $49. Was able to purchase a name brand tablet for less. I was all in. Going to Best Buys to make the purchase was well worth the trip and the price. The Kindle Fire has not let me down to date. I can read books, google, read my email and most things I can do on my computer."
facundo,4,Good tablet for a beginner,"This is our fifth kindle in the family. I bought this one for my son to replace a similar one that stopped functioning after a few months. So far this one is working well. But just in case, I bought a one year warranty in case it fails."

Idahoskibum,5,Great value tablet,"These tablets are a great value -- theyre perfect for kids or users who just want to browse the web, read, etc. They are not the most powerful but for the price they're an amazing deal.PS use a search engine and learn how to sideload Android apps. The Amazon store is a bit limited and missing some popular apps. Sideloading removes that problem all together."
Lasondawun,3,Great birthday present,Got this for my daughter & grandson for their birthday.
Kenb322,5,Love the tablet,"Great and easy to use, showed me how to set up the tablet"
Crazyfireman112,4,Great price on this!,Don't care for the ads on this. But for the price its good. Ads can be removed for 15 bucks through Amazon.

Sara,4,Great tablet for my daughter,"We bought this as a birthday present for my 8 year old. It has almost everything she wants on it. Only problem is Amazon's app options are limited compared to Apple or Google Play. Other than that, she loves it."
Veee,5,Great buy for the price,Works well for my children. They both have one and seems to run smoothly for the games and apps they use.
ReaderRob,4,A Great Buy at $50,"For what the Kindle Fire does, at $50, it's practically a steal. The reason why I bought the Fire was because it's excellent 'Read Aloud' function. There are many books that do not come in Audiobook format, which I need- I don't have as much time as I would like to sit down and read these days. The Kindle Fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while I'm working out, or driving.Good points:It reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.Amazon can convert most PDFs into a readable format, and you can change the speed. Battery lasts pretty wellBad Points:The Fire's OS could use some reworking- switching bluetooth on and off isn't exactly convenient, being buried under a few menus, which don't seem to be customizable.All in all, it's a great buy at $50!"
khand28,5,great device,Perfect gift! Great apps and reading material. Would buy it again
balaji,4,good with low price,nice product with low price.i will recomend to my friends.working good.

Jwilbourne,5,Best Remote,"The best remote for the price you cannot beat it, easy to use"
Robin,5,Great product,Got this to replace my son's cheaper tablet. It is well worth the extra money. He loves it.
Tezcatli,4,Decent Quality for the money,"Overall a good tablet. The screen is crisp enough to enjoy videos. The only downside is the built in speakers. Even with headphones, the sound quality isn't top notch. Just average. If you're not looking to do anything fancy. It's a good deal."
Wlee,4,Good,It's alright personally the picture quality is pretty bad but I guess that's what you get for paying 50.
Mcamacho68,4,Great alternative,I wrote the review previously thinking it was the Amazon fire. Turned out it was the case I reviewed. The Amazon Fire is a great alternative to the kindle and the case is sleek and not bulky.
Princessa,5,Great for kids!,I bought 2 tablets for my cousins and they really love it! The tablet is easy to use and very handy.

PamB,5,Great For The Price,"Bought two Kindle Fires, one for My Son and the Other for My Nephew, as Christmas Gifts. They were on sale for about $53.00 and I must say that it was very well worth it. The size, weight and portability is amazing. My Boys get to watch all their favorite shows and take pictures. It keeps them busy while I get done housework. I'm extremely glad I chose the Kindle Fire and I would definitely buy again and recommend to a friend. Fyi, My Son is 6, My Nephew is 3 years old."

Haaq,3,Its okay,This is good for beginners but not very good . Its wifi work terrible
Bethie777,5,Amazing tablet for the price,"Although not the most powerful tablet on the market, I would say it's a phenomenal tablet for the price. Compared to my ipad air 2, it's an inferior product, but considering it was 15-20x cheaper, it is impressive today the least."
Alvarezch,5,Love this product!,"I read a lot, this tablet makes it convenient for me to carry many books without all the weight. The screen lighting is adjustable for different light situations."

I would highly recommend it to anyone."
Trez,5,No thrills No brainer,"The fire isn't going to thrill you like the iPad or surface, but it gets the job done. If you use Amazon video, HBO go, Netflix or any streaming device then it's a no brainer."

Microsd,4,Decent tablet for money,This is a good tablet. The only thing that would make it better is it being HD.
Lee89,5,Great Value Tablet,Simple to set up and use. This is the second Fire 7 inch I have purchased. First one was for Mother-In-Law for Christmas. She loves to read and this tablet works great for her. I use this one mainly to play music through blue tooth speaker on deck. Battery life is very good. Also Grand kids love to play games on it.
WiredBob,5,Exactly as advertised!,"Great product! You get exactly what you pay for, plus more."
Rooster,4,Great tablet for kids,Purchased two for my 8 yr old twins. They love them and the tablets have held up under their abuse. Only issue was not being able to fully block purchasing. Lots of in app amazon ability.
Fire,5,Good for reading,Couldn't ask for a better tablet to read with. Does exactly what is says. I have kindle unlimited and read all the time. Battery life is excellent
KrisB,5,Nice tablet for the price!,It is very user friendly and worked well for my travel needs!
Heather,5,Great tablet for price,The Amazon Fire Tablet does everything that I need it to do and for the fraction of the price of other tablets on the market. Screen size and weight are both great.
Aspect54,5,"A great tablet, doubly so for the price.","This would be a great tablet even if it were $100. Picking it up on Black Friday was literally a no-brainer. I saw it, looked at the price, picked it up and bought it. It is great for all age users. Not great for graphically intense games, but if you want that you need to pay for it. For a casual, everyday tablet (also great for watching movies on the go) you can't beat it."
Jason,5,Good tablet for the price,We got this tablet for our son to use in school and it's perfect for just that. At the right price too.
DaddyRick,4,Good Value Tablet for Kids,"Good, inexpensive tablet for kids. It's nice being able to set up an account for kids that limits screen time. Amazon's Underground apps (free apps) and discounts on ebooks adds to the value.The only con is the limited built-in storage (only 4GB free after you account for the system software), so an SD card is highly recommended."
Danielle,5,For my 5 year old!,This was perfect for my 5 year old u can set it to their profile so they can't buy anything or access the app you don't want them too. Best buy for kids who want a tablet!
Anonymous,2,Not a big fan of Amazon fire tabs...,Not a big fan of Amazon fire tabs...got one as gift from grandparents and it memory on 8GB gets full too quick and no way to expand

Cori,5,Great tablet,My daughter loves it. Its is a very good tablet for her
MRLCJR,4,Nice For Reading,Nice tablet for reading articles and downloading books. A downside is Amazon limits some of the apps that are available. For the price it's a good buy for my purpose.
JDTECH,5,Great 7 entry tablet,The Amazon Fire is a great intro tablet. I got this for one of my youngest child so I could setup time locks for usage and other parental controls. If you want to use Googles Playstore on the device then you have to hack it on there as it is not available in current builds.
MiNes,4,Great buy finally!!,"I had to go through 2 tablets before getting this one, which is the best that I have ever had."
Kindel,4,I like the product.,A very useful and easy to use tablet. I use it almost everyday.
MamaBear,5,Great tablet,"I have two Kindle Fire tablets, both the 2012 and 2014 versions so I'm rather familiar with them and how they work. For my son's 7th birthday, he asked for a new tablet. He'd been using Leap Pads for the past few years, but was also used to using one of mine when needed. I debated back and forth between this version and the Kids Edition. In the end, I chose this one. In having a kids profile set up on the Kindle, all auto-pay turned off, and being able to decide which apps I put onto his profile, I felt this was a better option. The tablet is quick, good size for his hands, and has enough memory for any of the apps and books I want to put on it for him. We found an awesome case to protect it. For the price, I don't think you could get any other tablet. I am very happy with my choice and will likely continue to choose Kindle products."
AppleFanboy,5,Best deal for the price ever,"I needed a tablet for my kids and this was only $50 plus a memory card and they had so many games we were able to take a 17 hour road trip and they were entertained the entire time. As far as Android Tablets go, this one gives the most bang for the buck that I've ever seen."

llaw406,3,Decent tablet for the price,"I own 3 of these kindles, for my children who are young. They can take some wear and tear, but recently one of mine quit charging. The charger will no longer connect with the port inside the kindle. The kindle itself was working just fine, but since it can no longer be charged, it is no longer functioning. I am really disappointed, and plan on buying a replacement. My children love being able to play on the kindle and for the price you really can't beat the deal."

Slim,4,Beginner or intermediate user friendly,"Bought this for my 9 year old, he loves it. Great buy"
Nick,4,Great starter or travel tablet,"Great tablet for kids. Also great for travel as you can expand the memory allowing you to store music, games, movies, etc. battery life is decent but doesn't charge back up very fast so that is one downside."
EPSRedhawk,3,Good for what it is,"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably."
Leash,5,Great value for the $,What a great product for the $. It does exactly what it needs to and then some.

Cirrus,5,Good Tablet...Great E-reader,"The Amazon Fire 7 exceeded all expectations that I had for this device. It works great as an e-reader, and is a functional tablet as well. You may not get the stunning resolution of an iPad or higher priced tablet, but it certainly gets the job done when watching videos or tv shows. Amazon's app store is also better than expected. The expandable memory (micro SD card) is a huge plus for me also."

DeesKid2,4,Difficult to get started.,I did not receive any instructions on how to begin using my Kindle Fire. I started using it before I came across an important note that I should charge it before using it. I plan on utilizing the Geek Squad to get me started. I have tried on my own but get frustrated when I can't get what I'm looking for in order to operate it. I feel confident that once I learn to use it I will be satisfied with my purchase.

It's been easy for them to use and learn -- though I highly recommend a keyboard case. I bring it out to read news sites in their new tablet formats. Small but useful. An amazing product given the price.

JRiv,2,Okay Tablet,"The Kindle line is great for easily syncing into existing Amazon accounts & it's a great tablet for basic functions, like internet use, video streaming, music streaming, apps, etc.etc.etc. However, the tablet cannot currently stream downloaded movies from Ultraviolet, which is a pain for most users that primarily bought this device for that purpose. I would currently not recommend the purchase of this device until you find out that Amazon has fixed the issue, if one of your criteria(s) for the perfect tablet is to be able to watch downloaded movies!"

The 7inch display makes the 1024x600 resolution appear crispy like any HD. The educational game I purchased is fun and noticeably working. The parental controls are solid and his profile includes a safety browser with pre bookmarks added to Disney TV shows and his favorite Thomas & Friends.

Anonymous,3,It is an Amazon device. Period,"Bought this for 4 year old to watch Netflix and movies via Google Play.The entire user experience is Amazon-centric. The OS appears to be Android-based but is repackaged/rebuilt as FireOS. As a result this device does NOT have an Android OS user-interface.I was able to install the NetFlix app but I did not test it. You cannot load the Google Play app, which means that all the kid's movies (i.e. Toy Story, etc) that we intended to play are not available. For this reason alone the device is getting returned today."
Mona1,4,Good tablet for the money,This is a great tablet for the money. Runs fast and works seamlessly with Amazon Prime membership. Prime is not required to use this by the way. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a tablet for entertainment. We havent tried to use this for business purposes though.
edizzle,4,Surprising little tablet that do a lot,This tablet from Amazon can do most things like the bigger more expensive tablets at a fraction of the cost. The two complaints I have with it which are minor is the camera is not very good especially in low light and the battery does not last as long as an Ipads. Other than that it has plenty of apps and things that it can do like Netflix etc.

It is small enough that I can take it with me without being too small to read."

Well, I am totally amazed at how good it is, especially considering that it only cost me $33. I download ebooks from my library, surf the web, do my email so what is there not to like? Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of an iPad but, for me, it is the ideal portable internet device (even better than my mobile phone)."

BennyT,5,Awesome Fire tablet!,"I recently bought this on sale at Best Buy for $34 on Black Friday and couldn't be happier. While I wanted primarily an e-reader (which this does very well) I also use my new 5th generation Fire 8 for Facebook, CNBC, Fox, and CNN news updates, Alexa queries, and occasional email. I added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my Amazon e-books on it (and yes, you can save all your e-books onto the micro disc. Just read the documentation as it's easy to do). While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa. While doing I needed to call Amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful."

MOMMAB,4,Nice product for the price point,"Not as good as the higher end Kindles, but nice product for the price point. If you're an avid reader, and especially if you are an Amazon Prime member then this product offers an incredibly great price for entry into the Kindle reading products, especially now that there is Amazon Prime reading. For even more value and selection, join Kindle Unlimited. In short: This little device and a Prime account offer an incredible selection for countless hours of reading. I can't see how you can go wrong, unless you plan to watch videos and then I recommend one of the nicer Kindles...maybe? This one can do the job, it's just an entry level, basic model; but for reading, I don't believe you'll ever wish for more."

Elenita,4,Good tablet for the money (if it doesn't overheat),My first Kindle must have been defective as it was overheating. Because I bought it at Best Buy (and their return time was over) and not from the company all they would do for me was give me a discount on a second one. I finally accepted and the second one has worked perfectly. This is a good option for a cheap tablet.

Workingmom,1,Disappointed,I picked this up on Black Friday and ended up returning it the following week. This may be greater for an e-reader but can't replace a tablet for emails / amazon shopping.
smig142,1,Not worth the time or money,"I bought this and the kids version past Christmas. Its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books. Don't waste money on this product. The kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps, when they work takes forever. When they do work, the kids enjoy them. So I consider it to be a hit and miss. I'll be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up. Not wasting money on it."

With that membership, you get to read, every month, one their amazon unlimited kindle books. To take advantage of that aspect of your prime membership, you have to read these books on your kindle, and can't be accessed on other android tablets. That's 12 books to read for free a year. Best of all, mine was on sale for $39.99."

MobileTrekker,5,Excellent VALUE,"I'm not a huge fan of the modified Android interface on this tablet, and it is FAR from the best tablet on the market. Not even close. But I am giving it 5 stars based on its value. It is a very durable and functional tablet and includes a camera AND a microSD slot for cheap, easy, expandable storage. Throw in the excellent integration with the Amazon ecosystem (if you use that) and you have a very worthwhile device. If you are not a big Amazon user, I don't think it has as much to offer, but it is still nice for an ultra-low-budget tablet."

When they went on sale at Christmas, I decided it was time to get myself one, after, of course, buying three for unsuspecting niece and nephews. I have an older iPad that I love and use but it is limited due to upgraded technology. This Fire tablet is perfect to do all the things I could not do elsewhere. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you owe it to yourself to get one of these things."

Traciw16,4,Good tablet,Works well for the purpose of reading and a few games.
7portusb,5,Kindle,"This is another standard Kindle color screen product that replaced our original Kindle 7"". This one is much faster and has more access to apps, although they are all through the kindle store, not android app store. I couldn't for example use my Mcafee anti-virus.

bll8,4,Decent tablet for a good price.,"I was having issue with the wifi for my main laptop, so I needed something that I could check email and writer posts on. Now I mostly use it to play games and watch shows through apps. With all of that, the battery only lasts for a little over 3 hours before it needs to be charged. The tiny charger that comes with it isn't that long, so don't expect to be able to do anything with the tablet while it's charging. So if you need or want something that's bigger than the average phone screen to watch movies, read and check email or read books, I think this is a good bet."
Vick,3,Ok tablet,I bought this tablet for my child because he previously had one. Not much storage and the cord strips easily.
Brandy,5,Awesome,"Bought this for my kid, easy to use. Set up parental controls so they don't shop on Amazon, and it's quick."

SF61,2,Dead within the week.,I purchased this for my mother in law. She is getting old and wanted something she could see.The font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something. It really wasn't a good fit for her.The device died approximately 1 week after purchase. We returned it for a refund.
Alicia,5,Awesome,Purchases as a gift for my niece in the Caribbean. As soon as I gave it to them they hooked it up ti the wifi and was ready to go. They enjoyed every minute of it
Alfredo,4,Great for cheap tablet,Great for kids inexpensive wouldn't mind buying again
ChuckCar,4,Tab for my 4y.o. Son,Loved the amazon fire tablet. I bought it as a Christmas present for my 4yo. I bought a case too because as you know kids tend do drop things... this tab was awesome because it linked up with my amazon account and I had control on what my child was viewing. I liked that the price was great and the product is durable. My son thinks it's awesome.
FLRealtor26,4,My tech-unsavvy husband likes it. Me... meh.,"My family has been enjoying Amazon stuff more lately, and the Kindle Fire Tablet is no exception! I haven't spent enough time on it to get what I need as efficiently as I can on my Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1, but my husband prefers it to his Galaxy tab 8 (currently in use by our 10-yr-old son). Remotes are too complicated sometimes... our family joke anyway... but he'll sit down and browse the Amazon content, get all the car stuff he enjoys reading, and I haven't heard a complaint or call for help. I haven't even heard any annoyed-caveman sounds! I like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet. May sound trivial, but my main complaint with both Galaxy tabs is that the inputs are on the bottom, so they can't sit upright for use while being charged (bottom-portrait for the tab 8 and bottom-landscape for the tab 10.1 - either way, it hinders function). Functionality during charging isn't disturbed with the Fire tablet. When I'm ready for a new tablet, I'll probably get the Galaxy Pro because it seems friendlier for bloggers, writers, etc. but the Kindle works if you're not looking for something too complicated. Price-point is great too."
deee,5,great little device to take on trips,You can keep watching your movie on the go if you have to leave the house.
Rich,4,For the Money you cant beat it,Watch amazon prime and netflix on it for cheap. What else do you need from a tablet that costs under $50.
FrankT,1,Lasted 120 days...30 past warranty,"Died after 120 days....30 days out of warranty. Some no name brand lasted us 3 years before this one. Figured we would get a ""name brand"" thinking that it will last longer. I won't be purchasing Kindle/Amazon products anymore."
LostinVA,5,Great gift for your Dad,Wanted to give my father another way to read his books or play his games without lugging around his laptop. He hasn't put it down since he was given it for Christmas. Easy to use and has a lot of options available for apps.
ladylove,5,great price,Great table. In fact t am typing this review with it now
acadapter,5,"Amazon 7"" Fire Review",Good size for my toddler and resolution is very good.
Joncman,5,Great for the basics,"This is a great starter tablet. Does all the basic things and is only $50. Not gonna find a better one for this price. In this price range your not gonna find a faster one. Get an SD card and you can put stuff on the card eliminating the one weak point of the tablet, only 8 gig of memory."
DT82,4,Good tablet,It's a little slow on some things but otherwise I really like the tablet.
Dawn44,5,Love it!,"Bought this to use to read my textbook on trips when I didn't want to carry my laptop. Fits what I needed perfectly. Lightweight, and the battery is lasting a long time. Easy to set up."

Duel33,4,Awesome gift for the kids,I bought 6 of these for christmas for my nieces and nephews. Best gift for the price. they love them for the online and app games.
Customer,3,Messes up quickly,"The product is good for children. The downside is, the tablet's charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use. If you plan on giving this to a child, make sure you take care of charging it for them, dont let them do it on their own, or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker as they are a bit careless."
Kyungw83,5,Inexpensive tablet,Kids loved it would buy again good storage works well

Dun1988,4,Great tablet,Bought this tablet for my 7 year old. It doesn't have the best amount of memory but it does have a spot for a mini SD card. It's pretty durable and easy to use.
chrich,3,good for the money but Silk is terrible,Silk is painfully slow and doesn't work on many websites. Had to install Mozilla to use bestbuy.com ironically. I can't put in orders with Silk (the default Fire browser). If using Silk make sure to disable the caching to Amazons servers. With caching on the browser is almost unusable.Ads are really annoying (only come on when you first turn it on) but I don't even really notice what they are. Usually things I'd never purchase like makeup (I'm a guy) or other junk. These make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too. This is not a quality device like a Galaxy Tab but for the price its good enough because you know they're going to break it at some point.
Jeff,5,Great pad for kids!,"I purchased this pad for my boys. It is an excellent pad for a great price. They use it for all the popular apps, along with their favorite games. Sound, picture, and the touch screen are all great. I couldn't be happier with my choice. If your looking for a great pad at a great price, look no further, this is the pad!"

3gr8kidz,5,My kids love it!!!,I bought both of my young boys one tablet each. They absolutely love their tablets and very easy to use. Rarely do I hear arguing while they play their games whether it be letters and numbers or racing.
agee19,5,Who needs one million apps?,"For the price you cannot beat the deal on a tablet. Crystal clear picture and very fast. OK, so the wide variety of apps available on an apple or Android are not here. But most major apps are, and if the app is not available just go to their website. A simple fix."
pamt,5,Great Tablet,I am so glad i got this tablet i can take it with me anywhere and use anytime
Somebody,3,Mobile easy,"2nd kindle liked the first one better space bar located to close to change menu icons download is slow and have great internet service, device freezes up a lot and have to shut down and reboot, must close out any open tab to open a new one one happy with this model"

West352,5,It great,Wish I didn't have to sign on with a card but great product
carrollwr4,5,For what it does you can't beat the price,"I purchased this simply for reading kindle books. I was able to get it with a reward certificate for $40. It's biggest issue is glare, more so in the sunlight. I bought an anti-glare screen protector and it made a huge difference, but it is still difficult to read in the sun. I'm still very happy with the product."
grimlin21,5,5 stars,Great tablet. Very reliable. Only problem was the ads. But they didn't bother me too much. Overall a great buy.

AtrixHDUser,4,Great product for an Amazon user.,"Great tablet for the price if you are a user of Amazon's services. Plays movies, videos , music from Amazon's Prime service great. If you don't use these, it is an OK android tablet. Does not support the Google Play Store directly but can be sideloaded. Not a great experience tho."
Wolfman,5,Great product.,We got this for our daughter before an overseas trip. She got a few books and loved it. It has worked well for her.
GMunny,4,Great tablet for kids,"Bought this kindle mainly for my kids. There are plenty of games that my kids, and I, enjoy playing. Having the expandable memory slot was one of the reasons I purchased this model. Happy with my purchase....we have three of this model."

Gary1982,4,New fire tablet works well so far !,Mostly use the Fire on the bus ride to/from work for You-tube/g-mail and Face-booking and it functions very well for thise uses and constanrly keeps up with the wi-fi when i switch buses Sometimes I have to reconnnet but mostly not ! I have to charge mine about once a week and usually give it a top-off of juice over the weekend. Battery life might be an issue if I ran mine more intensly but works for me. Does alot of stuff I've really only scratched the surface of what it can do.
Dayday,5,Convenient for every day use,My son loves his tablet it keeps him occupied and well behaved

Mruizgalindo,4,Great design,It's a good tablet for the price although battery is not the best
Meowkins007,4,Can't beat the price!,"I was looking for a tablet that I could download movies on for my toddler to watch on long car rides. This Kindle Fire has great parental settings so I don't have to worry about my child accidentally buying things or seeing inappropriate content. This runs much cleaner and faster than older generation Fires. I was a little taken back by the size since I have a much bigger one, but It'll work out great for what I wanted it for. I did notice I have 2 burnt out pixels, but they don't bother me enough to return or exchange."
Brandy,5,Love it it's awesome,I got this for a friend an was very pleased. The fire tablet is awesome. It dose everything the kindle fire dose.
Bbbb,3,Pretty good,"Tablet itself is good, I mostly use it to read on the go. However, this tablet only works with Amazon approved apps. As long as you don't mind it, this is a good choice. Get it on sale for a better price"
Lori,5,"Great tablet for reading , Internet, light weigh",Light weight easy to take with u . From reading to Facebook for all your little needs
PleasedCustomer,4,Great price!,Good entry level reader that is easy to use. The resolution is great for that page turning novel. Has lots of other bonuses too.
Trish83,4,Good tablet for younger kids,"The Amazon Fire tablet its self I give a 4, I thought it had the Google Play Store on it and the kids couldn't find the games & stuff they wanted But my youngest loves it! Walking him through the whole process ( after the other kids tried it out I did a system restore back to factory settings) I liked it and so did my son! So all in all I think 4 Fits well!"
Peru,5,"Great, compact","Excellent for travel, games, email, small enough to carry"
Firewalker,5,"Better than I expected! Music, Movies plus books!",so much better than my 3 year Fire for versatility.
AMG2,4,Works well,Our first one was defective but was replaced by Amazon. Our replacement works great.
Kawapipiq,1,SLOW,"I got mine for a month, and I mainly use it to read PDF documents from SD card or OneDrive. The tablet is nothing like the reviews said. It FREEZES up every time I press ""Home"" or go to the next page or even to close out. When I go on the internet, some pages do not load fully. 9/10 times only the 1st half of the page was loaded. I am very disappointed."
dvdmrrs2,4,"It's a cheap tablet, does the job","Fire , it does the job I wanted it to and that is to entertain my kid and myself. Nothing fancy and it does have it's quirks and bugs. Sometimes can be frustrating on response time with touch screen and loading."
Steve,5,great product,got this as a gift for the wife. she loves it and uses it a lot.
kira,5,Good quality for a tablet,Amazon fire is perfect for kids and other teens. Its not that expensive compared to ipad while the quality of product is pretty good.
Microsophie2,5,Works well,"My daughter is away at school, and she uses this inexpensive Amazon tablet, which she won't is should something happen to it, and it'll be easy to replace. It has all the functions she needs, though it doesn't support some apps, but it does support all the popular social media and has a decent camera. It's easy to use, big enough to read on, but it's not huge, and it's easy to hold, store and carry. My daughter enjoys the orange cover."
Scooby,5,Gift,Nephew loved to play games and listen to music. He never puts it down. Very good buy.
Jamie,3,"Good for the price, but space is an issue","For $50 this is a fine tablet, However I bought a 64gb SD card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it (for example Netflix). So be warned that you will run out of space and consider the one with the larger internal storage."
djhtechdad,5,Excellent with Prime,"The tablet is as you would expect at the price point, nothing too exciting in terms of the tech. But, add a Prime membership and this device really excels at giving you access to all the Prime perks and adds another voice control point for Alexa."
Robotjockey,5,Kids love it,"Bought this for my son, and he ises it all the time."
Enthusiast,5,Great,You can't beat this for the price. The Internet is fast and a good reader.

User182,5,Great overall tablet,"Simple to use, works very well, and at an unbeatable value for price."
Connie,5,Love this little tablet,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Got it for $33..couldn't beat the price. We found this was a greal alternative to pricier tablets and clunkier items such as laptops and Chromebooks, when all you wanted to to is check email or do surfing. Display is great, Definitely recommend"
wmagle,5,Kindle Fire,We bought this for our son and he loves it. He can read his books and also play games on it.
nuriamcb,5,"Absolutly great, i love these tablets","This is not the first time, I bought these tablet several times, because they work excellent, I sent one for my best friend and she love it, I like everything from this product."
wahoo,4,Amazon kindle fire,Good economic solution for a tablet to surf the web when neeeded.
Anonymous,5,Can't beat this for the price,"Purchased this for my niece for Christmas. She loves it. Great for the kids, or if you're not looking for anything specific. Lightweight, easy on the eyes. You don't mind spending that money especially for a kid that may break it...because they're kids."
Trek,4,Best tablet you can get for sub $50,"At sub $50, the kindle fire pretty much falls under disposable. That said it is a fantastic little tablet, good enough to do almost anything you would want to do.Only downside is the mono speaker, it is a little of an issue when listening to music over the speakers. If wearing headphones, the sound quality is ok and you get stereo."
football64,5,great ink packs,"The item that I needed was very good in value and easy to find in the store The cost was reasonable and exactly what I was looking for, which was what I needed for the new printer that I also purchased at Best Buy. thank you"
Greg,5,Great tablet,Great tablet! My fiancee uses it as an ereader for books she downloads from the library.
Poolman,4,Nice tablet,Very durable cover Takes the abuse that a 3 year old gives it
RegularSlightlyOldGuy,4,Fire 7 Inch 8 GB,"Bought this to replace a previous tablet that died. Popped in a 16 GB micro SD card to add memory. You need more, 8 GB is not much. This tablet throws plenty of marketing at you, but in exchange you get a lot of functionality for not much money (I paid 40 plus tax). If you like intense gaming, you'll be disappointed I think, its not super powerful. True it cannot run Android apps, but its an Amazon product, so there are lots of apps out there. For my light weight needs, it works well."
Bedo281,4,Great tablet for starters,Very compact and easy to use. I Just wish it had Google play store but amazon is still great.
Domss64,4,It's a great tablet but just too small!,It's nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it's just too small.

bearbud,5,gift,Gave as a gift. Hope it is working as planned. Nice sale price.
AnnieM,5,Great tablet,"I actually bought this one for a friend as I already have one. She reads all the time, and I told her this is what she needed. I'm not even sure she has taken advantage of all the other options that come with it but she loves it for reading her books. She is an older lady so I help set it up for her and have not had to help her do anything else. She has been able to navigate thru it with no other help. Greatest gift I could have given her."
lady,5,great tablet,i am 61 years old and do not know a lot about tablets. i mainly play the games but it is great for that
kabuki07,5,Great device,My daughter loves it. She can make her videos and listen to her music.
Marlenaasmith,4,Great tablet for the price,"The first kindle I purchased only worked for a week. Thankfully, Best Buy did a full return. This one works like a charm! My kids love it!"
Eeld,4,Bought this as a gift,The person I bought this for loves it. She had another tablet that was actually more expensive but she couldn't load apps or anything to.
g3sun,4,Can't complain for $35,"Bought it on black friday sale. Use it as a ODB reader for car and reading books every once in a while, for $35 there's nothing wrong with it"
Luv2buy,4,Great for simple tablet,"I got this for my husband because he only uses a tablet to read and occasionally look up items he's interested in on the web. It has been perfect for the light use he puts it to. He doesn't have a lot of knowledge about using computers etc. and this allows him to read, play simple games and check out guns and other things he's interested in without having to learn how to use anything more complicated."
merr2,5,User friendly for a beginner,"I researched about tablets and based on my interests I choose the Amazon Fire 7 tablet and protector, I wanted reading and games mostly."

wa4tij,4,Great cheap tablet,"I don't really care about the built in Amazon apps. I use this tablet for Xfinity TV streaming and it works great. Since it's Amazon, I don't expect them to abandon updates like the cheap Chinese tablets. It's not speedy fast, but for the money it is hard to beat."
Grandma,5,Nice,"Have bought these for myself, grandkids and daughter. Nice size to put in purse and easy to take with you in car. Lots of uses for this."
TIGER,5,3 year old,My 3 yr old granddaughter loves this item! PERFECT
morganc4589,4,Ok but not great,"It is great for reading, but that's about it. There are ads that are quite annoying as well as the slow speed of the device."

Adam1,1,Do Not Buy This Tablet,"I bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price. However, it only lasted 6 months before the battery died and was not chargeable, regardless of troubLeshooting and what cord or outlet I used.Best Buy said they couldn't do anything but said Amazon could help me since it should be under warranty. I escalated multiple times with Amazon and they refused to help me each time. So save your $49.99 and put it towards a good product."
mpheimlich,5,Great for kids,This was a very nice unit and easy to use for kids. Good value
Angel,4,Great for kids!,Got one for my nephew... very easy setup and has a ton of games to download!
uncleblue,4,excellent tablet for the price,its a great device I bought it for my great niece and she loves it
splatt116,5,Easy for a Senior,"I bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke. It was easy to set up. More importantly, it's easy for her to understand. I did have to create an Amazon account for her just so I could download her favorite apps. The only challenge I had was she uses Gmail for her email accounts. It took me a couple of tries to get her Gmail into the stock email app. So far, she is happy as a lark with her new tablet."
Billyt,5,Great little tablet,Can't go wrong at 40 to 50 bucks.I also have the 8 inch and prefer the 7 in the hand.I bought the eight for the extra ram 2gb instead of 1 but haven't seen any differences in the 7 or 8 while using it
Thomas,5,How could I go wrong?,"So here was my dilemma, I could buy a cheap tablet from a no name manufacturer and suffer lag time, battery problems, software problems and all the things the bad reviews said or I could buy(on sale) an Amazon Fire Tablet and get a great screen, great battery life, Alexa, wifi, access to my Amazon Prime goodies and an easy to us OS..hmmmm, which way should I go? Needless to say, thrilled with my Fire tablet, use it all the time and wondering why anyone needs to spend more when this thing does so much for so little."
nelly4dust,4,Great tablet,"I bought 3 of these tablets for my nieces and I was a little worried about the quality because they were cheap. The quality is great and my nieces love them for playing games, watching videos, movies etc. Turn out to be a great purchase."

sancyn,4,nice price,It was great for my 73 year old mother.She uses it for the Bible.
Chocolate,5,Killer deal,I bought one specifically to play music videos in my car with the Bluetooth sinced to my stereo. It's awesome.
Couldntfindheadphones,4,Great for reading on the go and while eating,I really like this product. It's easier to read when I'm eating because I don't have to hold a book and turn the pages. Basically I have both hands to eat with and only need to tap the screen to turn the page. I will say though the battery seems to drain a lot faster when you are using the wifi and looking up books or just searching the web. That would be the only bad thing about it I would say. Other than that it is an awesome purchase
LAAF,5,Great for audio books,"I really wanted a ""value"" item to load & listen to audio books both while at home and on the road. This is PERFECT. So quick and easy to load books via an app or the free library app. Pleasantly surprised....such a great little ""reader'."

Gator,3,Nice price,I have bought multiple fire tablets and will continue too. I would advise to get the protection plan for any problems and we have had a few. The tablets work good for the most part but I would upgrade the memory to 16 if you are going to play a lot of games.
James,5,Great tablet,I bought this tablet for my 10 yo granddaughter and she loves it.
MusicalMama,5,Excellent for the price,Spending money on the cheaper one with ads is worth it. The ad only pops up when you first turn it on and that's it. Have not had any issues with it in the few weeks we've had it.
Bobwillie22,5,Great product for the money,My daughter wanted this product for herself. I got this unit based on the price and size.
Rtwistedmindz,5,Good tablet,Great easy to use tablet.... Grabbed it for my daughter and she cant get enough. Gets the job done ...

Gary,4,Perfect gift,Got this gift for my girlfriend daughter and she loves it good deal thanks
theonlyrealmj,4,Great for the price,This is a great low end tablet and it is sold at an amazing price.
TypicalB18,3,Good Tablet for Basic Use and Kids,"I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better."
Jessica,5,Great tablet for beginner,I purchased this as a gift for my parents. It's easy for them to maneuver.
Amanda,5,Gift,Bought this as a gift for someone but I haven't heard of any issues

TOTO,5,EXCELLENT FOR MY CLASS,MY STUDENTS ENJOY USING THIS PRODUCT FOR LEARNING .
DeeEss,4,Great value for quality tablet,"This tablet is a great value. Tablets in this price range usually end up failing quickly, but this tablet has held up perfectly for almost a year now. The 8GB is somewhat small, but adding an SD card has helped with storage. The lack of Google Play is a nuisance as the app selection is more limited, but by adding Aptoide, I was able to access many of the apps that are available in the Play store, but not Amazon."

walham,5,very good amazon fire. I prefer it to the 6 inch o,"I really do not understand why Amazon has moved to the 6 inch format.

kristar028,1,Replacement Tablet for my son,"Had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty. Had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement. Lots of family suggested the Amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from. Well set up was a disaster. I wasn't aware that this tablet let's you put up to four names under one Amazon account, until after the initial account member name was completed. So now my 7 yr old has an Amazon account. Also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up. And then had to go into settings to put a parental block on in-app purchases. Too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on. In not happy with this tablet . It automatically backs up photos and stuff to an iCloud. I don't know what that is , how to access it, nor is there an icon on the screen for it. Also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that can't be changed. My other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal. I will not be replacing his with this product."

shannon,5,Great tablet for a beginner,The Amazon fire tablet has alot of features im very pleased with it.
metalman629,5,Great Kindle Fire,The Kindle Fire I purchased at Best Buy is awesome for people to read books online and search the web. It is one of a kind!
DrArt,5,Best Kindle Yet,"I hadn't bought an ""updated"" Kindle in quite a few years, so as the battery on my old one wasn't holding a charge very long, and searching or downloading anything became a half-day event, I felt it was time. So, off I went and purchased the latest 7"" screen Kindle Fire, and holey moley what difference. This new one is incredibly fast, has a beautiful picture, amazing capacity (plus a SD slot for expansion), and a two-way camera to boot! I'm still learning all the new bells and whistles, but so far this has been great and looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship!"
Kira25,4,Does the job,"Great for my 5 year old, but battery only lasts 7 hours if it's not being used!"
Carol,5,Compact device,Love my Amazon Fire tablet because it's not too small and not too big. It's just the right size. It's light weight and the resolution is very good. I recommend it highly.

sanbey,2,i can't use this on the airplane,"the internet server SILK is not compatible with free wifi on southwest airlines and I bought it to use on the plane. also I cannot hear the audio even with the sound all the way up on the plane. so I don't really need it since I have a computer , iPhone and kindle at home."

JFoss,4,Great for kids,Got one for my kids and they love it! It was super easy to set what apps they could have access to and stream prime shows. Not a huge fan of the Amazon app store compared to my android phone.
3BRBS,5,Best deal for the money,"This tablet is your best deal for the money. Since it uses an adaptation of Andriod made by Amazon, it is technically possible to install Google Play app store without routing the device, if you read a bit online, making this tablet probably your best buy if your budget is tight. Absolutely recommended."
1-Jan,5,Love,Love Kindle! Thanks for creating this gem! Granddaughter loves it

Drawdaisy,5,Great little tablet,"This tablet is great especially for a child. Granddaughter is responsible but accidents do happen so I didn't want to buy her an iPad till I saw how she did with this. After playing with her fire and being able to download so many free games, she informed me that she does not need an iPad. Needless to say she is very happy and so am I. I like that I could buy the smaller gb one since you can add an sd card to it, to increase the storage. This is really a great purchase."

Raph,4,Good decent tablet for the money,"Got this tablet as a gift for my mom, who is 72 and is a little not used to high technology, so she uses this tablet mostly for Facebook and reading an e-book. Works fine, but if you are an user that likes high resolution screen, plenty of storage and fast processor, this is not your choice.Good streaming can be done though."

taebrown88,5,Tablet,Bought this for my 7 year old daughter. Great first tablet for a child.
Princessdecent,4,Decent and good price,"Bought one for my mom a few months ago so she could have a bigger screen than her phone . Didn't want to spend too much since they are not big on any kind of electronic. Does the job. Good price for this product. Bought a second one for my dad. Only downfall is I couldn't remove all the pre installed apps on their home screen . Besides that, pretty happy with this tablet."
Usman,1,Not a good tablet for kids.,"I purchased this tablet on a discounted price as an alternative for RC tablet. The operating system is not good, very slow response, apps takes a lot of time to open. Many of the apps like youtube is not made for fire OS, so my little one has a difficult time handling it. After 2 months, I got him RC tablet."
babyduck,1,Super Disappointed in the new model,My son had the original kindle fire. It was great! Simple to use. It finally bit the dust. I bought a new one. They made it way to complicated. It is going back. The power button won't turn off. The notification box won't stay off the screen & the apps wont run. They just keep loading.
DarkLord,4,Great little tablet,"Great tablet for the money, especially after you put the Google Play store app on it(see xda forums for instructions on how)"

Debba,5,perfect tablet for my children,"Easy to navigate, relatively durable, sweet little tablet!"
Denisr,4,Very good,Good phone but my return visit the customer service was horrific
VK123,3,Ok tablet,"Bought this tablet for price and for a little kid using it so I wasn't expecting it to be a flag ship device but this really isn't the best. The amazon version of android really ruins things.. you can't get the same apps that you would get from the Android Play Store. Many apps on this Amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others- for ex- Youtube, someone basically made the website into an ""app"" but its $50 so its whatever"
Calitraveler,4,Inexpensive device for kids,"I bought this has a gift for my kids. They love their Amazon Fires. A few down sides with the internal memory and speakers. Pretty weak in these areas. The memory and speakers definitely could use some upgrading. Fortunately the device has a slot for memory cards and we can connect to a Bluetooth speaker. To get the maximum use of the device you need Amazon Prime. Compared to Netflix, Prime is very competitive."
sebas,5,great tablet,the kids love it they learn something every day i'm happy i bought it
Chelle,5,Great for children and adults,My eight year old granddaughter loves it. Did research and the best deal was at best buy.

RoRo,5,Tablet,It is a good tablet to have. The books are good...
PCGremlin,4,Great value and runs most Android apps,"I purchased this after trying the Insignia 8"" tablet which unfortunately had a charging problem. The graphics on this tablet are OK, though the contrast is not as good as the Insignia's or other more expensive tabs.Integration with Amazon for reading is excellent. Tablet is responsive and speedy. Construction is sturdy and heavier than the Insignia. The Silk browser runs well for all the sites I visit."
OracleLisa,5,Great if you know what you want out of it,"I love this tablet, and use it as an eReader mainly. I love how this is capable of reading my books to me (if they're compatible). My favorite feature for sure! Thay way I can listen while I'm cleaning the house and my kids love to listen to them too. It bluetooths to a bigger speaker without a problem. Tactically the screen is so nice, i love the feel. The Internet browser is a but clunky, so if thats your main desire.. This may not be the best. I feel it does well for my needs. I have found most apps to suit my needs on the amazon app store."
lisabanks,5,Great Tablet,Love my tablet was going to by laptop but bought this instead cause this is cheaper
penczy,5,great value,great value as a beginner's tablet for a young person.

Baslaw,2,Amazon Tablet,Nice tablet for children - Works well as a gift for the price
Lisa,4,Great for children,I bought 3 for my grandchildren and they love their tablets
rosco,4,Easy for kids to use,Bought this for our 6 year old to use instead of spending the big bucks on an Ipad. It has pretty much all the same apps and it is easy for him to navigate around. Parental controls prevent him from downloading anything above his age level.
mnglfiddle,5,Excellent basic android tablet,"I bought this Kindle Fire for my daughter for Christmas, and she has completely enjoyed it. Build quality seems good, and I have been impressed with how Amazon has increased the functionality of its basic Kindle Fire over the iterations of this product (I also own a first generation Fire). It remains a very viable product and a joy to use."
pops,4,childs tablet,good for the 7 year old grandson to use easy parental controls

Denise,4,Great Gift,Bought for my 8 year Old Granddaughter. She loved it
Jace,4,Great for my son,Even with onky 8 gb it's pretty quick. Only issue is downloading the free webroot... its not compatible
wastrel,4,Great value,"At $50 it's worth getting if you have Prime or just use Amazon a lot. At $40 (on sale right now) it's a bargain. There's only one thing about it that's somewhat of a drawback: not very good battery life. But keep it in an area with a strong wi-fi signal and use Airplane Mode when you don't need wi-fi, and you'll only have to charge it every night. Seriously--every night."
DirkDiggler,5,SISTER LOVES IT,I bought this for my sister as a birthday gift and she loves it.
Jarry,5,Great tablet,Very nice tablet for the price and great for kids.

WMorgan,5,Good product,Mom really love it for Christmas. Easy for her to use.
Dyates0801,4,Great,Great. Works great for the kids to do their online homework.
Mommyof2,1,Weird ads as a screen saver,I bought 2 of these on Black Friday and these have to be one of the worst buys of my life!!!! The screen saver can't be changed so my kids are forced to look at ads every time they want to use their tablet. Apps are ok and to be honest I could have dealt with the ads but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card. I bought my kids sd cards so they can have more than 4 games and the tablet doesn't read it or something. It says sd card inserted but it won't download apps to the sd card!
samsunghead,4,Kid Tablet,Bought for my nephew. He didn't know how to operate it. It is a little tricky. Would not recommend for a child
bose,4,great buy!!!!,Kids absolutely loved this gift for christmas!!!!!
alsb805,3,No Play Store,"Well, a good table for under $50 it's not bad. I ended getting the Toshiba 4k tv with built-in Chromecast so I need an inexpensive table so I wouldn't use my phone. Turns out that the tablet does have Play Store so i was unable to download Google Home. This tablet would be great for kids for a started tablet. you can also control how much time kids can spend on it. unfortunately it wasn't for since it didn't work for what i need."
Gators,3,Good if you use Amazon alot,Great for ppl that use Amazon and Amazon products. The price was great to.
VoodooDragon,4,Kindle Thumbs Up,A great E-reader that doubles as a tablet. This model even has an expandabel memory slot. Great price I bought 2 for gifts
dcd8585,4,Great for the price.,"Got two for my kids for Christmas they have been great so far they hold a charge and there not slow. I bought two off brand tablets last year of lesser quality and they didn't last very long, These have been worth every penny. The only negative is that you will have to eventually expand the memory"
Icky51,4,Great Amazon Fire,Works great. Love the size and light weight. Love it!
Katie,4,Gets job done!,"This is a good tablet for what you pay for it. You can read books,play games and surf the web. The only thing I would have done differently is I would have bought one with more storage!"

Samantha,5,"Easy to use, good value",We have several tablets and iPads in the house and this is one of my favorites
Robert,4,Quality at a low price...,"Picked this up on the black Friday ad. $13 and it's one of the best readers I have in the house. I've got nook, iPad and Android devices which don't operate as good as this reader. But it only serves that purpose in my house."
Anonymous,5,Great gift!,"Gave this as a gift. The receiver loved it and uses it all the time. I personally have an older Kindle, and I was jealous of the updates and find it to be much more like a tablet than the older Kindle Fires."
SB57,5,Great Price,Purchased tablet for 4 year old twin grandchildren. Also purchased the protective cover. Absolutely love it.
WyldeBill,5,My wife loves it,I bought this for my wife after she started having headaches from doing Facebook and email on her iPhone. The larger screen makes it easier for her to use for an extended period of time.
Butch,5,Great gift for the grandkids,We bought two for grandkids and one for mother-in-law and both are happy with the product
Gonzolean,4,Amazon Fire 7 tablet,They have come a long way since I purchased the first kindle Fire. It's a worthy successor and a very good tablet for the budget conscience person.
ilse1311,3,Good for the price,"Readers are going to like this tablet that includes the kindle feature, it has basic tools like camera(not very good), calculator, calendar, and the amazon appstore. I didnt like that it doesnt include the google appstore, cause the amazon appstore doesnt have some of the apps I use the most on my cellphone. It is good for the price anyways..."
phillitc,4,Nice tablet for 3 year old,The tablet is good and great for younger kids free download
Steve,5,Great,Easy to use and understand. It's a great purchase.
BillR,5,Fantastic Tablet!,Bought this tablet so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop when traveling. Didn't think I'd use it at home but I find all sorts of thing to use it for there too. Sure my phone does some of those things but the bigger screen is easier.I also didn't think I'd use it as a reader but I slowly got hooked. For $40 it's a real bargain.
Maddog,4,Tablet,It is a good tablet for kids wish it would be a little better with games
Resse,5,Great,My son loved it he was so happy when he opened it up
lnbrotherlaserprinter2016,4,Great,Great to replace internet 5 day weather forecaster that stopped working. Nice looking display & easy to use. Price was great !

RAM123,4,Great tablet,This is what we were looking for. Works great. It connects easily.
Tedthebellhop,5,Not a bad tablet for the price point,"I bought this for my 9 year old. It perfect for playing not to heavy games and for reading. The only down side is that not apps are available in the amazon App Store. Others than that not bad at all. Also side loading the no available apps don't work all the time. If your looking for something to surf the net and watch movies on, then this little table is perfect for you."
Will,5,Product is excellent for any technical level,Enjoy all the features of the tablets from gaming to pictures. Battery life is good as well

rabbit9413,5,Great for toddlers,I wanted to get my 12 month old a tablet to start with and this was a good pick.
2gether4ever,5,Love the Fire tablet,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire Tablets for my god-children for Christmas and they love them. The tablets go where ever they go! They play games on them, as well as play educational games to learn different skills needed for school.I love that Amazon made the Fire tablet kids proof and the screen isn't so fragile."
fjceli,5,Nice Beginner Tablet,It's no iPad but you can't beat the price. Makes a nice gift.
Allen,5,Replacement,This was a inexpensive replacement for a device that was damaged by my kids. Would continue to purchase if needed. Great for kids 5-6 years old.

RJCHM,4,Covers what is needed,Functional for what I need. Compact so travels well.
TimothyG,4,Fantastic price for a solid tablet,"Being a dedicated Apple user (with an iPhone, iPad mini, and MacBook Air), I didn't except to buy an android or Fire (which uses an OS very built on Android) tablet. But with this Fire tablet being sold for just $40 during the holidays, and some of the Google apps (I was most interested in Play Music) offering different functionality on Android/Fire tablets than on iOS devices, I thought I'd give it a try. After using it for 6 weeks, I can say the Fire is easily worth more than $40. It looks great, works well, and is light and easy to handle. The downsides are that the OS seems a little slower than iOS on my iPad, and the wireless router doesn't seem to be as powerful."
Patty,5,Great tablet!,I use it for reading and I love it! I could take it anywhere.
Landon,5,Great for kids,This item was for the kids for Christmas. The Amazon FreeTime feature with multiple child user profiles is a great way to help balance learning and productive time with their fun time.

drw30,3,It's ok.,"The tablet is good for a 12 year old, i got it for my niece for Christmas and it will do what she wants,which is to play games and read books. Amazon is a little annoying because she had a hard time downloading some of the movies, because it wasn't ""compatible"", which is dumb since its their tablet and their site she was getting them from."
Conni2you,4,Great little tablet,"This is a great little tablet. It is wonderful for reading, Going online and using apps. The only reason I gave it four stars was because there are a few apps that my family enjoy using that cannot be downloaded onto this tablet.

StewartAndrews,4,Fun little tablet,"I bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them, so I decided to get one myself. This was my first personal foray into an Android based device being a tried and true iOS devotee, with a Mac and iPad. I will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do, the Fire tablet is great. The OS and processor make it a bit clunky and it's definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing, but for basic activities, it works great. I particularly like the easy to use and transport size. I still prefer to read on my kindle but I do read on here as well. If you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movies, music, reading and other media driven activities (ideal for Amazon Prime members), this is perfect."
candyman073,4,great tablet,this tablet is the perfect size and very light weight. It is easy to set up and does everything I need it to do. Having a camera is useful too.
Riverfork,4,Not Mine,I bought this for my son. He absolutely loves it. His purchase was mainly based on his friends having this model and being very pleased with it. He is very pleased with it.
ManlyMan,4,Reading buddy,I basically use it to read news articles and stories online. It works well for what I use it for.
Reviewer,4,Super little tablet,"I have owned Kindle's for many years and have always been very happy with their portability, performance and ease of use. The highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this Kindle for my son. There are only two areas that I am very disappointed: the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one-touch purchases (and I mean one-easy little touch) I must set the controls either off or on. The problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content I normally allow him to access...big problem. Now Amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. This is an issue that I am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. The second issue, Amazon's Kindle app store is weak. If you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as Facebook....a major app and a major downfall to Kindle use. Because of this last issue both my son and I have Apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our Kindle. All this being said however, My son and I both very much enjoy what the Kindle's do have to offer, so they get a GOOD rating because of this....however because of the issues I discussed it was difficult to choose between an AVERAGE and GOOD rating."

Diogenic,4,Good value for a e-reader +,"Bought this primarily to use as an e-reader. Got it on Cyber Monday so it was a pretty good deal. I live in the Google ecosystem so I loaded it with the google apps after buying it. I pretty much ignore all the amazon stuff. If I want to use the internet I either use wi-fi or access it via using my phone as a hotspot. It is a decent size for reading, although I think I would have been better off with 16 gigs instead of 8 for storage. I have installed a 32gb micro sd card for extra storage."
Myra,1,Real Bad,This product is real bad from amazon. Although i dont expect much from a cheap tablet however this was even below my expectations. Its way slow to respond to anything or everything. My 3 year old goes after my ipad when i give him this....wont recommend to anyone.

PROS: very sharp display, fast screen response, fair speaker, low price.CONS: need adding memory in form of micro-sd cards and becoming an Amazon Prime member to make this tablet worthwhile."
Pastime106,5,Unbelievable value! Love it !,"Between my wife and I we have three apple I-pads. I purchased the fire tablet for myself and one for my daughter. It is an entertainment device. You can serf, email, watch movies on line and it makes an awesome remote for my Fire TV. It really pays off if you are an Amazon prime member. It has a version of the Amazon echo- but not quite as the echo or echo dot. I love the fact that you can add a micro sd card to greatly enhance the storage. Perhaps they can teach this process to apple. After using this I have to admit that I have purchased my last IPad."

Tawaunad,4,Great tablet,I bought this as a gift and my nephew really enjoys it.
jkenyon,5,Great All Around Tablet,"This was my third Fire 7"" 2015 to purchase. One for me and two for gifts. The apps in the Amazon appstore are not a numerous as in other stores, but I've got email apps, games, office productivity, everything I ""need"". For a simple to use tablet it gets the job done very well. As an e-book reader it's great, but not outstanding. The screen is not as nice as higher end models, but for the price and quality this unit can not be beat! The speaker is mono and not as loud as nicer Fire units, but again this is a sub $50 unit.I use mine daily for email, web, some simple games, I've even sideloaded a few apps that work great (Your mileage may vary).Expect to like the unit for what it can do and you'll be happy. If you think this one is as good as a $150 tablet, well look elsewhere.All the sub $50 tablets I've seen out there can't hold a candle to this one's build quality and features."

MAXIMUS,4,Great for Web browsing,"Good tablet to browse the Web, good for a beginner"
Mariamne,5,"Fantastic gadget, I use it everyday.","I originally bought the tablet because I enjoy putting together jigsaw puzzles. Not having time to do them at home, I found apps that I could use on the cell phone while on the train. But, anything more than 125 pieces was just too many for the screen. I've found that I can do 225 piece puzzles comfortably on the Kindle and, for the amount of puzzles available and the time I can spend on them, that's good enough for me.But, the Kindle offers so much more. There are other great games and puzzle apps from the APP Store plus there's a six-month ""free"" trial subscription to the WASHINGTON POST. You can go online via WiFi and download books, read email, watch movies and videos, and surf the Internet, just like on a regular computer.It's great fun!"

waggem25,4,not for web surfing,fire is slow when surfing web. i am not used to amazon app store which is way inferior to apple store
GoodMan,3,Screen too small. WiFi does not work well.,This tablet is okay however the screen is too small and the WiFi does not work well. The WiFi turns off and I have to manually reset it over and over. The camera is nice however the resolution is not sharp enough for my needs. Does not make sense why there is not a version without cameras with a bigger screen size.
Instant,5,Great Tablet !!,Great Tablet for the price. Its very good for beginner.
Jniteson,5,Great for readers,was a great buy for my mom. would recommend to anyone who read a lot of paper backs.

Carebear,5,Great tablet/e-reader,Absolutely love my Kindle fire. Would buy for friends and family. It is the perfect combination of a tablet and e-reader.
Applebar,3,Serviceable tablet for entertainment,"The fire has a solid build, is not horribly slow, and has decent battery. Its major flaw today is the screen, which is both low resolution and poor contrast, with weak viewing angles. It makes a fine cheap tablet to hand to some kids though. For the price, not bad."
joebmxer,5,Fabulous Tablet For The Money,I can not believe how nice this Fire is for the $33 I paid for it. I would Not spend a lot of money on a expensive tablet when this one will do most everything the big dollar ones will do!
Kiml,5,Great product for my dad.,"This has been user friendly for my dad, who is 78. Always provides entertainment and meets his computer needs."
LBkd,5,Great Tablet for Price,I bought 4 of these and gave them to my nice and nephews for their Christmas gift. They are a awesome tablet for the price.
Eliza,4,Great tablet,This is a great tablet. I bought several for gifts. Best Buy had the best price. I only gave four stars because of all the ads preloaded to these tablets is a pain.
JanetO,5,Great tablet,This tablet is easy to use and a convenient size for travel.
JanetO,5,Excellent first tablet,Bought this for my niece and it works great. Access to all the apps she likes and easy to use.
techgeekwannabe,3,It's a $50 tablet,"I decided I wanted to ""try"" a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time. I researched the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 and settled on the 7 knowing that it is a low end device. The device is slick and easy to use, and the Alexa integration is really cool. But ""It's a $50 tablet"". At times, the performance is awful slow. I suspect it is updating content, say on twitter or FB. My complaint is when it is doing this, there are no visuals to let you know it is busy. I finally got on Amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. The reps at Amazon tried their best - and FWIW, I knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before I contacted them, but I thought I would give it a try. So get this if you want, just be patient. Remember, ""It's a $50 tablet"". If you want better performance, spend more $$."
Free2love20,5,Great Starter Tablet,I brought this tablet for my son for Christmas and he loves it. I would definitely recommend this tablet as a starter tablet for younger kids.
mike,4,Great for kids,It was really easy to setup for my kids and is a great size for them
Cbrimhall,5,Great tablet for kids,"This is an easy to use tablet. It was easy to set up and easy for my 6 year old to use. I purchased one of the off brand tablets for my other kid and have had a lot of problems with the charging port. Not with this tablet, worth a little extra money."
Bre211,5,Nice tablet!!,Bought this tablet for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it!!
Zorrbabe,4,Great sale item,I got this on a flash sale in at the moment and it was a great purchase. I didn't plan on getting one that day but I did and for $50 which I got it before it was totally worth it. I got a really nice blue colored Amazon tablet and I am happy with that. I can read books on it and use it when someone else is using one of the more expensive tablet I just want to relax and read a book. It is also great for surfing Internet you can play games on it as well. It is great for kids because it is sturdy even without a case it has still held up nicely .
Tejanogold1,4,Great tablet for beginners,Tablet is modest for it's price. Good for beginners.

Kacy,5,Great gift,These made great christmas gifts for my family that isn't too tech savvy but they love them and use it frequently!
SecretSquirrel,5,Gave this as a Christmas gift.,Gave this as a Christmas gift to my uncle because he has been given other tablets that did perform as they advertised. I have asked him several time if he is still enjoying the Fire and his answer has always been yes. I also purchased one for myself as well and it has continued to perform as well as it did on the first day I started it up. It is also a great tablet for someone who is a first time user of this type of technology. I would purchase another one should the need arise without giving it a second thought.
joea5,4,Great for daily use,"Great to use for a daily use, easy to use and light and great to watch movies."

Zimm,4,Fire Tablet,Basic tablet that we got for our toddler. Offers enough apps to keep her entertained and a low price point. If she breaks this I will not be too upset compared to other tablets.
BB4me,4,great tablet but......,I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the charging port. There is a small metal prong that lines up with the cable that can get bent if you do not plug it in VERY CAREFULLY. Have had to send one back because it would no longer charge. Otherwise great tablet.
Quanam,4,Decent for the price,"This was actually my second purchase of this tablet. Overall the finish is good; everything works pretty fine. It has all of the amazon services that you need like kindle, amazon music.... The touch screen still has some delay, however. Once in a while they put it on sale for $30. If your not in a hurry, like if you already own a tablet and are not really in need of a second one, then you can wait because I believe at the price of 30, this tablet is unbeatable."
Kelli,5,It's great,Easy to use for my mom and toddler. just like any kind of android device.

season44,5,Great affordable tablet,For the price it's perfect. Does all the basics well and if you break it you won't be heartbroken. Well worth it.
BBCust,4,Great tablet for the price,"Nice size. Functions as expected. Use it for reading books, email and a bit of web surfing. Like that you can turn down the screen brightness for night reading. Took off one star because it is tied to the Amazon store for apps and you can't easily edit Google docs & spreadsheets as you can on an Android tablet."
Slim,5,Good product clear picture,I bought this tablet for my kids on Xmas and they really like it ..
buyer,4,"Amazon fire tablet 8, daughter loves it:)",Bought it for my daughter. She loves it! makes me happy:)

bestbuymember,5,great buy,great purchase. it does everything as expected. very easy to setup.
technut,2,quirky and freezes,"From the first time I used it, the pages kept freezing and didn't respond to touch commands. I had to turn it off and back on daily. I tried to get a replacement and was told they no longer have them and I'd have to pay $10. more for a newer model. I bought 2 (1 as a gift). So far 1 works and 1 didn't."
SuperMoose,3,Good value... until the battery fails,"Bought this for Christmas 2015. After about 9-10 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. While the first 9 months were good -- as many of the reviews here laud this tablet -- the 90 day warranty is disappointing from Amazon. (When I did have a different Amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device -- so the only warranty issue is with the length.)I'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average."
BigBad,4,Black Friday Special! $33 for a decent tablet!,The amazon fire '7 tablet was $33 on black Friday. How could I not buy a name brand tablet for that little

TrueReview,5,Load movies for the plane.,Works great as a movie player. All I use it for is watching movies on an airplane or at sea.
Achilles357,4,Great for kids!,"I purchased three of these tablets as Christmas gifts for my kids. It was a great deal since Best Buy had them on sale for $33/ea. They were very excited to get their own tablet. The 7 inch is a bit small for my taste, however, great for kids. The Amazon service that provides ample apps for kids is a great deal since you can add up to four kids on one account."
LC325,4,Perfect for tween,"Bought this for my 10 year old nephew for Christmas. He uses it for kid games (not true gaming). Parental restrictions/blocks work well. He seems to love it. I think this is a perfect ""first"" tablet or nice tablet for an adult not needing all the bells and whistles of a more expensive one. It is smaller and easily carried so it is perfect for web surfing, reading books, and simple games. At this price point, I think it was a great purchase."
Momonamission,5,Great for all ages!,"I purchased this as a gift for a special needs child, he was able to use mine with ease so I bought his his own. Best Buy carries amazing covers as well and he is now able to listen to music, learn colors and numbers, and access movies in a fun interactive way. This is an amazing purchase for the price."

AvidPS4gamer,4,Great tablet. Cheap and cheerful,"If you want a tablet that is current and works well with the android platform and that you won't have a coronary when you kid drops on the floor, in the toilet, or anywhere then this is for you. We have 4 total and Amazon service if you have any issues is second to none. They even replaced previous ones for free when the charging port got loose but it seems that is now a problem of the past."

Lyssbuh,2,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this tablet on Black Friday and it was on sale. It's incredibly slow, and the screen quality is mediocre. What bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet. I only really use it to watch Netflix- so it's fine, but don't expect anything above that to function well on this device."

J1985,4,Gift for a four yr old,This tablet is perfect for kids and adults for me if I was the owner I wouldn't want a little bit more memory and ram but that's why I own a laptop now it has an interface that allows you to set up a profile for a kid individually That's what makes it perfect for kids and you control. It also has latest and greatest apps exc. It runs games ok but movies stream well and really for me this is great I have 4 girls from ages 10 to 4 and they all have something and this one is the best of all of them.
John,5,Great product!,This tablet is the perfect size for my kids. It has great parental controls functions and ordering apps is easy through Amazon.

OV1687,4,Good tablet,"I like the tablet. It works really well. I ended up purchasing two, a black one for my wife and I to use and a blue one for our toddler son. So far so good. I did get free virus software with the tablet as part of a black Friday deal but it doesn't seem compatible with the Amazon Fire although it's supposed to be. Thus far that's the only downside."
MikeBinRi,5,Awesome,My kids are pleased.............I am happy I made this purchase!

GQ77,4,I bought this as a Christmas gift,"I bought this when it was on sale for a Christmas gift for a child in foster care. I think this is a great tablet for kids but wish there was more storage as you know with kids, they like to download stuff. It is a great first tablet for someone who is just getting started."
AAVAYA,5,Easy to use,I purchased this tablet for all four of my children and my mother! Its durable and easy to use. My 2 year old has more fun with it than anyone else!

Arvind,4,Good one for cheap money,It's good for the low cost. Good one to gift. Does the basic job..
SeanA,5,Great tablet for an unreal bargain,"Amazon products amaze me for the value of what they are. This is no different. A great little 7 inch tablet where you can surf the web, watch movies, read books, or listen to music. Only really works if you have Amazon Prime. This really unlocks the potential. To really unlock the potential you can also subscribe to kindle reading unlimited if you read a lot or have several people in the family that will also read. I actually opted to return this one to upgrade to the Fire HD8 which was only about $20 more at the time and gives you a slightly bigger screen and HD resolution (I love to stream movies)."
Ksee,4,Great price Great Tablet,I didn't even know I wanted it until I was in line and saw it for 30$. Could pass it up! I think I paid more for the case for it. I gave it 1 less star because it doesn't have all of the apps and games I like. Otherwise works great and u can use a memory card.
Amanda1,5,Good product,Good adorable tablet. Don't have a bad thing to say about it. As long as you purchase a micro SD there is no issue with storage.
MrTool,5,Easy to use,I am very impressed with this set-up. I purchased as a cheaper replacement of an apple product and it does exactly the same thing.
tjones,3,Nice for the money,Its a nice tablet for the money but I just didn't like being stuck in the amazon universe .
AmyMSNRN,5,Amazon Fires,My 3 youngest boys got these for Christmas and LOVE them!
AverageJoe,4,Very happy with product ...,"Excellent product.I have purchased several ( yes, children can break them if they try ).I am sure there are limitations as it is an Amazon product ( -.5 stars) .My family does all they want with theirs, and are very happy (we have 4)..Mine is a year old and works like new.( I believe a previous model had an issue with the power cord they fixed )"
megabe,5,Very good tablet,"Very good tablet, the price is worth, you have and the price and quality in the same product."
John,5,This is an unbelievable tablet for the price,"The screen quality is excellent, and while not all android apps are available for the Fire, a vast number are. The batter life is very good and the responsiveness for the apps that I use is wonderful. my number one negative is it's continued use of the old industry standard USB cord and socket for charging. My wife often uses the tablet while it is plugged in, which leads to damage to the socket and the connector. This intern will lead to a third rate connection and the eventual inability to charge the device. I'm hoping that the new standard (USB C) will fix this problem in the future. For now, don't use the tablet (or any tablet) while it is plugged in!"
Kalee,5,Younger kids Christmas,My boys absolutely love Being able to do ABC mouse on here and I Feel this was one of my greatest purchases
VampyreDad,5,"Excellent Tablet, low price","This is a very well made tablet. If you can deal with the Amazon pre loaded apps, it is very fast. Simple to use and the best tablet for the price."
Matt,5,Amazing price and great quality,"The screen resolution, ease of use, and access to apps, books, and movies makes the Kindle Fire hard to beat. This is the 5th Kindle we've purchased (big family) over the past several years - have been happy with each one."
senecalaker,4,Good tablet,"This a nice little tablet although I only have used it very little. I bought it for a backup, because we all know sooner or later ones going to break down. For the price you can't beat it. Next year I may buy more than one."
Gigi,5,Bought for a gift,I bought this one my niece and she loves it. She also take it on long road trips.

Terry,3,Cheap tablet,"It's a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kids or whatever. The ads are annoying but then again you can't expect too much with the price point. However, I would not recommend using this for any kind of work at all because it's very slow and finicky at times but if you're tired of giving your kids your phone/tablet this is the product for you. Just make sure you take off your payment info, maybe even make their own personal amazon account."

compGeek,2,I would recommend for small children.,"In my personal opinion, this product would be unable to satisify any adult, whether it was for business or pleasure. Limited apps, limited space, slow uploading, etc. Also, due to this being an amazon product, many apps and options are unavailable, that are commonly used with both android and apple products. So I would not recommend to anyone."

webguru,5,Best Low Cost Tablet Anywhere,"The Fire Tab 7 is one of our favorite Tablets, and you can increase storage by adding an SD card. No reason not to get one unless you don't like saving money."
JRhisself,4,"It's OK, but...","The screen resolution is quite sharp & vivid, and the battery lasts a LONG time, but I found a major drawback: In a sense, it's like being confined to an AMAZON playground... big, yes, but accessing the BIGGER outside world can be a challenge. I often get sidetracked to AMAZON-authorized playthings, and getting around them, while doable, well, they don't make it easy. The only key is stubborn persistence."

bsfolega,1,Very disappointed,"I was expecting a tablet good enough for the kids to play and download games, and I was told at BB that this product would work for these basic needs. It seems like everything I download needs to be through my Amazon account, very few items are for free, and everything takes forever to download and/or open. Wish I could return it!"
pittsrp00,5,Great little tablet,Good for on the go. Keep in mind that some apps are not compatible due to it being Amazon and not Android. Overall a good purchase.
pittsrp00,5,Great little tablet,Perfect size for on the go. Some apps aren't compatible due to it being an Amazon tablet vs Android. But an overall good purchase.

DaQueen,4,Tablet,"Easy and convenient for my grandchildren, they really enjoy it"
Titan,5,Good tablet for kids,I got this for sister's son who is enjoying it so far with the apps and games.
Titan,5,Good tablet for kids,I got this tablet for one of my cousin's kids who is really enjoying this so far.
krish,4,Good one for the Price !,Got this during thanksgiving sale.. had already owned one.. Amazon could improve the UI for better user experience.
Blue,5,great tablet,works smoothly when typing search info to google things. constructed well. The casing is solid and well made. Operation of this tablet is great.
JoMomma,5,Love every thing except the charger.,My only complaint is that the charger does not fit in snugly to the device and I have replaced several devices as I could not get it to charge. They should take a look at Apple products and how they are constructed.
duckdog13,4,Great product for the price.,This was a gift for some kids in my family. Great tablet for reading and playing games/apps.
Albert,5,Good Amazon Fire,"I bought this Amazon Fire product for me to perform a basic web search, reading, and watch video online. It is a good product; however it does not have enough space to store videos."
KRob,4,Bang for the buck,"Great little tablet for the price, It does everything I need it to do. It has tons of apps, easy to set up and use."
Brad,4,Fair tablet,"Bought 7"" Kindle fire for my daughter to surf the web and watch videos. Bought 32GB microSD card, loaded videos and install apps there as the device only has 8GB RAM internal. This kindle has a known issue with not recognizing the microSD card sometimes, which requires pulling the tablet out of the drop-proof case (a pain), removing and reinserting the SD card until the tablet recognizes it. Time consuming and frustrating. Amazon doesn't seem too concerned with fixing this issue. It's minor really. Video playback is fine, but web surfing on the child's profile for educational sites is slow/sluggish. Not a fan of Amazon's ads all over the place and their app store is limited. For the price, hard to ask a lot. It'll serve it's purpose."
Tommy,1,That oke,"Onsale is 39.99 is cheap , good for new stars tablet"
elcap,4,Nice Tablet,"These are great tablets for anyone wanting to get into the tablet game. A friendly UI for just about anyone. Not to mention, for the price and being able to add an SD card for additional memory, makes this a great tablet."
MrsKnightENT,4,Stocking stuffer gold,"Easy inexpensive gift that you can rely on. Although i would rather have the Google play store as the main download application, it's Worth the money to buy for others."
Shaire,4,Good phone for a teenager's 1st,"This is my son's 1st smart phone and so far, it does what he needs it to do."

Chell,4,Great tablet for little ones easy to use,This product was very easy not only for my 7 and 8 year old nephews but it was rather easy for my 3 and 4 year old nephews to navigate as well. Still works from last year and thats why we purchased one this year for my niece.
Tabby,5,Great tablet,This tablet is great not just for adults but also kids. After having this tablet I'll never go back to a different brand.

Hopey,5,Impressed,Very satisfied with it as wellbas the serv8ce received form sale person
AdMan,4,"Not a full review, I only need 1 or 2 functions","So, I won't be able to go into super depth for this. I only needed a device to run one app. For my purposes, it literally has one job.I can say, for the price, it's far more responsive that I would have ever guessed. And the screen clarity is great. Good battery life.I was disappointed that the lock screen would always show ads. I don't have the package, and I don't recall it being forward with this fact. In the settings, I said I had to pay $15 to disable ads because ""in exchange for the subsidized price, they can do ads"" or something like that.I kinda get that, and for most people this may not be a big deal. But for my reasons, this is a bit unprofessional to have. So when buying it, whatever the price, you may have to shell out $15 more.Still, all said and done, good price for simple needs."
Emmy,3,Great tablet for young ones,Love the tablet! Got it for my niece and nephew! Great for beginners!!
Smiley,5,Makes a great gift,"I bought my wife the fire when they first came out a couple of years ago. She found it difficult to use and passed it onto our youngest son. He showed her all the features and when the latest fire came out, he bought one, showed us all it had to offer, she bought me one for Father's Day, and then she bought herself one. My son helped us set it up and showed us how to use all the featured it offered. We love it. We take it everywhere, especially in our travels. It is offered at a great price and I purchased two more for Christmas gifts along with the cases...Love them."
galaxys7,3,"OK tablet, with necessary tinkering","Since this is an Android 5 based tablet, I sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same as an Android tablet, with Google play store, etc. The screen resolution, speaker, RAM are just only adequate. Otherwise, a good cheap tablet. Really need to ponder its utility before buying it."
Curtis,2,not satisfied,"There is not enough battery life to read comfortably. 7 hours, maybe."
Notfastenuff,4,Good tablet for the price,Happy with purchase at sale price. Wouldn't have bought at full price.

Chrischris8010,4,Great product for the price!,Bought this tablet on Black Friday for a little bit of a deal and it was too good to pass up. I don't use it as much as I thought I would but it's still really fun and easy to use. There is an advertisement on the lock screen but I'm willing to deal with it for the price. Battery life lasts a while and it's fairly easy to use and understand.
cam1103,5,Great deal on my amazon fire ''7 tablet,"easy to use light weight, I love the games it has."
Rafy,5,Good product,"This is my second tablet, my daughter love it, just the perfect gift."
Bigeasy,5,Good tablet,"Im an Amazon fan so it was an easy decision to buy. Good battery life for music, movies and general web stuff. Fits my hand size well. Powers up quick. Screen brightness adjusts to any conditions. I would recommend buying in store cause I had to return 2 of them with a dead pixel. The one I have now has been good for several months."
PapaSmitty,4,Nice tablet for the price,"This tablet was bought to replace my Kindle Fire that had lost its video. I haven't used it a lot yet, but what I've done seems to work good. 8gb of internal storage and up to 128gb additional with a sd card gives you plenty of room for pictures,games, ebooks or videos. I will probably rate it higher once I've used it more."
Abby,3,Simple and easy to use,"The product would be great if it was easier to find the setting icon and if amazon wouldn't charge you a $1 for downloading applications that are labeled ""free."" The one dollar is automatically charged by amazon but you can dispute it with your Credit Company."
Ramber,5,great price great little tablet,I bought for my wife as a stocking stuffer.... Got for a great price after black Friday. She absolutely loves it. I have the older version of this and this version is way better

review1,5,I really like this version,I have an Amazon Kindle and this one. The kindle from Best Buy comes with some features that the Amazon Kindle doesn't have or offer like screensavers.
mikeyb1987,5,Great Device!,Cheap device running Amazon's OS. No problems installing apps or using the device. Highly recommend for $49.99 (or $33.33 during Black Friday).
pattycake,4,a good beginning,"I got this for my mum and she wanted it to watch movies in bed or download a book. It works well for this, but a manual would have been a boon as she is older and not tech savvy. It's not always easy or convenient for an older person to use new tech without a struggle. This wasn't too bad in the end, and she is enjoying it."
Will,1,Junk,A lot of apps are incomplete. Doesn't run apps that great and has a lot of apps that are generic.

WickedColt,5,Awesome price and features!!,This is a good all around tablet for a nice price. I have one for me and one for my seven year old and haven't regretted it. I suggest it if you have Prime and love tech.Only con is the cameras which are a bit grainy but I use a phone for pics
Sonymalc,5,Great tablet for kids,Inexpensive tablet that we bought 2 for the kids in the back of the car.
visioninternational,4,Best Android tablet for the price,The Kindle Fire tablet is no cheap Android tablet -- it is snappy and responsive. The price is unbeatable! More than an e-Reader!
Roydaman2,5,Another great product from amazon,Bought 3 for kids... they stay charged through play all day (7-9 hrs) and have been dropped and slammed a few times already but still look perfect and work just like new
Texas33,5,Awesome tablets,Kindle Fire image are very clear and very helpful my kid love it I definitely recommend to buy it
Laura,5,Can't go wrong for books with the Fire,I decided I need a device dedicated to my Amazon account so I purchased this. I have been using my iphone and ipad but wanted to have a device specifically for books. I've had kindles before and the products are so good.
mrspeterbug,5,great tablet,bought for my grandson easy to use for him . durable enough for a four year old
YaYa,4,Tablet for Grandchildren,This tablet is a good size for 4-8 years olds for their first one. After I bought and downloaded a few aps I realized that I should have gotten the tablet with more memory. Otherwise a good product. The table cover is a must to protect tablet
Tomy,4,Good,"A great tablet for a good price, it has the basics, works great for a child preferably."
pilotdan,5,Great device,My son loves his kindle. Loves the layout of software. Easy to download apps. User friendly interface. Bought the 8GB storage but bought expandable external storage to make it more robust. Very durable. Love the child settings to limit use when necessary.
Mikepro,5,Great value,At the price of $39 you can't go wrong. Great mobile device that is bigger than trying to use phone.
otterboxpurchase,3,Sufficient for streaming.,"Bought this device to stream Netflix, Amazon Prime, and to play downloaded content. For that purpose it is sufficient. I wouldn't use a Fire Tablet as a productivity device as it is seriously underpowered. Fire tablet bogged down pretty quickly when I attempted to multi-task. Bottomline, this is not an iPad replacement - particularly if you like to do a variety of things on your tablet. But at $33 on sale, this was a very good deal for my purposes."
Classy,4,Love it and you should get one,Love my purchases and you should get one as well love it
Deagle,5,Great inexpensive tablet,My child loves it workes flawlessly and does everything she like to do

Jzgame,5,Fire 7,I highly recommend this item. This is my second purchase of kindle fire. I was so pleased with what you can do with the amazon kindle fire.

Erica,5,Great tablet,I purchased the tablet for my Christmas Angel. He loved the tablet and case.
DSLRML,5,Great tablet for the price,"I picked up three of these during the holiday sales as gifts for family members. We have many Kindles that we use daily the last few years and been satisfied will all of them and Amazon offers all the content you could need for a base tablet. Great for adults or the kids (with a proper protective case). Books, video, music, and games...performs well on all. The only con I can think of is Amazon is a little weak in the app variety department, nowhere near the offering of iTunes but for the price and performance, this tablet can't be beat."
Izzy,5,Good product,Works great!! My brother loved it. It's easy to use!
Stumpy25,4,Good purchase for my 8-year-old.,"Got for my 8 year old. The parental controls are nice. I wish the netflix app was registered as ""video"", so I could give him 30 minutes of games and 30 minutes of video. I'm sure this works with purchased videos, maybe prime, but not netflix. He Star Wars Commander, netflix, and reads books. It's a good size for little hands. It's great that as the parent, I can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. I bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for hands-free video watching."
rksj0000,5,"Awesome entry level tablet, perfect for young kids","We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!"
Sheldonsite,5,Kindle,This is the fourth Kindle I bought as a gift. Perfect for any occasion.

Drew,5,"Kindergartners love it, and so do I!","I got this as a second Kindle e-reader as well as an educational and leisure tablet. I also have a Kindle Keyboard; I thought that I wasn't going to enjoy reading on the Fire because of the back-light, but it is very adjustable and has a setting to turn the blue-light off for reading at night. I also wanted my kindergarten students to be able to use it educationally; it has a kid mode with great parental settings and an option to pay $2.99 a month for tons of awesome content!"

Joonie,1,Don't buy,"I purchase a fire after my nook died. I had problems with the first one saying I was connected to the web , but not being able to connect. Took it back and the geek squad looked at it and after trouble shooting for a while, they decided there was something wrong with it, so I exchanged it for another one. We set it up and it worked initially, then I went home and the same thing happened as with tg first one. So I took it back and got my full refund . While not happy with product, best buy customer service made me happy."

zivasmommy,5,Great price for a great little tablet,"I didn't want to spend a fortune on something, I just needed a quality tablet to read my books, check email, play on Pinterest and Twitter, etc. This price is phenomenal for the quality. I actually bought one as a gift a few weeks later."
drako1164,5,Great product,I have purchased the cheaper tablets. They never last. I purchased this for my brother who is never in one place long. He is able to stay connected and enjoys carrying this tablet everywhere.
Nelliesloan,5,Like a lot,My daughter love it so much and she love caring it around with her
Fletch,5,Great Budget Tablet,For the cost of this tablet it is amazing. You can upgrade the storage via a microSD card so you won't run out of room. The Amazon version of android is easy to navigate and if you have a prime membership can't be beat.
DRMC,5,Great low cost option,I purchased this as a drawing for my business. Everyone was very excited about the prize.
ym25,3,Reader,"I like the reader, nice and small. What i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. I had to go to my daughters house and set it up. That is a bit alarming. It should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. Make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. That is the only reason I didn't make it a 5 star product."
Peaches1975,5,Great for young teens and adults,I purchased 2 I share one with 2 small children also purchased an SD card games shows movies books galore the expandable memory is the best
yvonneee,5,Perfect for my son,"Works great, he can enjoy his apps without interruption. Now we just need one for his younger brother since the only negative thing is that he wants to take it away every day."
KevinV,5,"Considering the price paid, A+","I paid about 33% less than the going price for this. I can't complain for any reason on this based on what was paid. Is it the perfect tablet, well, there are some limitations, however, I've paid far more in the past for comparable tablets that didn't offer any more than this. I picked up multiple ones and they are scattered through the house and all being put to use."
Tezcatli,3,Decent Quality for the money,It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it. So for the most part it's a good solid low end tablet.
Benco,5,Absolutely Love This Tablet!,"I wanted a cheap tablet to watch movies on. It streams all apps well ( Netflix, YouTube, and others). The only complaint is the internet browser is garbage. I also have a fire tv and 2 fire sticks. Amazon products work well."

Fred,5,Cannot beat the quality of this tablet,"For under fifty dollars this little , durable , expandable tablet can't be beat!!!"
WJenkins,4,Excellent Tablet,"I've found this to be an excellent tablet for children for the following reasons:Free Time Unlimited- You can create individual profiles for up to five children, and they can have access to a wide assortment of age appropriate apps, videos, and books. If you purchase the Kid's bundle a year of Free Time Unlimited is included with the tablet along with a shock absofbing case.Price Performance- You get a relatively powerful tablet for the $49.00 price tag. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime this tablet becomes a great travel companion. Prime allows you to download movies and TV episodes to your tablet for later viewing. This is a handy feature for me since I travel for work, and spend a good deal of time on planes. Cons: The only drawback I've found is the Web browser. It's not supported on in flight WiFi, but the ability to download from Prime for later viewing balances that out. I will experiment with side-loading Chrome and see if it works."
Papadrake,3,Decent product,Decent product that has great value. Definitely buy again for a gift

Adro,4,Great value for the price,"The Amazon Fire tablet is definitely not the best tablet out there, but it's definitely the best at this price point. It has all of the features I was looking for without the fluff. It may be limiting if you don't have an Amazon account, but it's not a deal breaker. I think this is a great tablet for those who aren't looking for all of the bells and whistles."
Nom1,5,Easy to use,"I bought 2 fires for older friends. 55-60 years old. They run jw library app on it. It has never given them any problems.

Ebcrawford,3,Great buy for younger adults,"I bought this tablet for my son. He used it for mainly games. I though he would like reading his books on it but he prefers the actual book vs digital books. It works great, fast, and vibrant colors. I play with it on occasion. It fits in my hand at night and it's larger than my phone but not as expensive as other tablets. All in all it was worth the money."
ncaa380,4,Great Tablet for the Price,I purchased the Fire Tablet with expectations of a average performing tablet at best. I was surprised to see that the tablet performed way better than expected and is still doing so. I would recommend this tablet to anyone that wants a good performing tablet without a HD screen.
NewKindleUser,4,"Useful Reader, Shopping Experience w App Quirks","I was pleasantly surprised that I have enjoyed the Kindle Fire. This was my first ever use of buying books on Kindle due to summer courses I was taking at the time in May/June 2016. WHAT I LIKED- Kindle Books Synched on MacBook and Fire tablet: very helpful when it came time to write my papers. The highlights I made while I read the book on the tablet synched to the version I read on the MacBook desktop. This helped a ton, especially with things like formatting the footnotes.- Watching Videos: cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen. - Amazon Shopping: I can now understand people's Amazon shopping addictions.l I will give it to Amazon, this tablet became my gateway to using Prime and countless hours of online browsing. Prior to this I rarely purchase items online, I can see how they have made it so easy across platforms. - Portability: I like that I will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE- Sign-on Screen Ads:There is no way to turn them off. I suppose for $39/49 depending if you purchased on a sale, the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet. However, I wished this was stated as a ""feature"" before purchasing it, I may have paid the money and upgraded to the next Kindle if I had known it could not be turned off. - Turning Off/Standby Mode: This took some time to get used to rather than an issue. When you turn the tablet off, it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain. You have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned OFF. - Weather App: I don't know if this is just my tablet, the weather app does not update as soon as you open it. It takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather. I have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue. I have instead downloaded and used other weather apps. But at this point the app is worthless. - Screen Resolution: It's not the best, but I got used to it. For reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient. - Screen Dimmer/Blue Light Mode: I read and use the tablet at night, and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen. And the system's default dimmer and Blue Light feature is awful. The Blue light app allows you to set the color tone however, it is so orange it makes it unreadable. The app I use instead is called Bluelight Blocking. And even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me. So I have had to download the app Dimly so be able to set the brightness."
Matt,4,Great all around tablet!,"Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this tablet will appeal to you! Easy to understand tutorials, smooth animations, and more user friendly than Android or Apple products (and yes I own some of Samsung's and Apple's latest mobile devices) $49 is an amazing price!

Dilbert,5,Great Amazon Fire Reader,Bought an Amazon Fire Reader and it is great. I am able to read books and take it wherever I go.
Kdhar,2,Average product,Not the best and the brightest in the market. Bought two of them and one got damaged within the second month. Best buy was not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair. Good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long.
happymom,5,Kindle Fire,Very pleased with the Kindle Fire. Great price too!
BoneHED5,4,Replacement for a Nabi,My wife bought this for my 6 year old son after his Nabi-Tab went south. Overall has been a solid purchase
Bjsu,5,Best value you can get for $49,"This 7 inch tablet has just enough power to let you do your daily tasks, it's touchscreen is fantastic with a decent display resolution. It will give you everything that you will need from a good tablet. The only downside is the camera. I wish the front camera should have been of attest of one mega pixel."
Woden,5,Great product,It's a great tablet for the price... my kids love it...great parental controls
Nick,5,Great,"Bought for husband's grandmother. Works great for her, she has not called for help after setting it up with her:)"

Katkid,4,Great for the price!,"Purchased this for a gift for a 75 year old, who is enjoying it as she learns all of the ""amazing things it can do!"" She loves playing solitaire and downloading current books to read before she goes to bed at night. Easy, fun, inexpensive tablet for even the least tech savvy people! :)"
nikhilp93,5,Totally worth the money,for $50 this tab does what it is supposed to do. It has the gaming apps and social networking apps. You can take photos and videos. Its like a poor man's ipad.
jakestorm,5,Amazon Fire 7,Great little tablet! The expandable memory makes this quite a bargain!
kaedae,4,Great for kids,"This is my third Kindle, first two worked out great for my kids so I got another. Great value for money"
Andy,4,Mom likes it.. kindda.,Got this for Mom to replace an aging iPod she was using. She is reluctant to adopt any new technology but I have loaded all of her apps and saw her on occasion slowly warming up to the device. The only issue I have with Amazon Fire devices is that not all Google Play store apps can be installed. For example you cannot have access to Google Hangouts which Mom would like to use. Anyhow it is a good overall device for people who are starting to use new tech items.
MsFairfax,5,"Great Amazon - Fire 7"" Tablet","Bought it for my granddaughter. She had an older Kendal which she gave to her younger brother but not a Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet. She loves it."
Telecommando,2,You get what you pay for,Price is nice but performance was not. Sluggish to the point of frustration even to my 4 year old. Would be fine as ereader or maybe basic web device.
MackWayne,3,Nice kids tablet,Nice kids tablet for a decent price. I bought it for a road trip.
AngieR,4,Great inexpensive option for my 5yr old,The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with many free apps for kids. I set parental controls to prevent internet access. My only issue is that the Amazon App Store doesn't offer the YouTube Kids app. Other than that he's had the the tablet for about 4 mths & we've had no issues.
Kelrg32,2,Too many ads,Don't like that Amazon has so many ads going on this thing. Makes it pretty not fun to use.
PastorDave,4,"Good product, great price",Present for daughter. It is a good tablet at a great price.
Kimmy,4,Great buy for the price,Great buy for the price. We currently own 4 of them. Buying my grandson one for Christmas too.
Meka,5,Great tablet,This tablet is just the right size.. my baby was ale to use it on plane. But i would recommend a bumper if you buy for kids.

blugrass12000,5,Great tablet!,For the money you just can't beat this little tablet!! I have used it quite heavily! I used it during a trip I took and had to rely on it while my computer was in the shop for over a week and it has performed beautifully!! I would recommend this product to anyone!!
SharonC,4,Good tablet,"This tablet gets the job done! It is a 50 dollar tablet, so know it is limited in what it can do. It does what I purchased it to do. Basically read email, watch videos and to do social media. You shouldn't compare it to a higher end tablet. NOT the same! You'll have no complaints if you know going into purchasing, you get what the price reflects!"
Juan,5,Great for books,All I've used this tablet is for books and it's great for it.
Angel58,4,Great tablet for kids,"I bought this tablet for my 6 year old and he loves it,so do i."
Dinesh,5,Good,Good and performance is also good worth the money spent
Themrscrossno,5,Amazing,This tablet has been a huge lifesaver. Not only do I have movies for my son on my tablet but I also have my games and his games so it keeps the whole family happy. It's super user-friendly so even my one year old can figure it out. Connecting to Wi-Fi is super simple and it has amazing features. The speakers on it are amazing. I catch things in the movies we watch more on this tablet than I do on my own TV. All around family friendly tablet.
Lady82,3,Not bulky,"Its light weight, i do not care for the amazon app store..Android is so much better..I cannot get all the app I need from amazon..the amazon Kindle is a nice size and light weight.."
Awesome,5,Good device,I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She had been using a Kindle in the past and needed something new.
Pbechtol,4,In store customer service is terrible,"Very satisfied with the product, I have one for each of my kids now and for that the price point is amazing. I have a pretty big beef with best buys in store customer service at this point, I ordered a different color to help keep my kids kindles separated between them. The color I ordered for my 6 year old came in but they sent the 16 gig rather than the 8 gig. Instead of GIVING me the color my 6 year old ordered the customer service agent behind the counter absolutely INSISTED that they couldn't do that and canceled the order making me take one of the colors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my 6 year old son who did not get the color he had wanted. Very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchases with best buy."

Frygirl,4,great for shoulder to shoulder training w/ video,This is a great easy little computer to have if you just want something to access the internet that doesn't require a phone contract. We are using it to run training videos off our training website so we can do shoulder to shoulder training. Works out great for that.

celianic,5,Awesome for price,So glad had opportunity to purchase for only $33! Amaazing tablet for Septagenarian. Always wanted a Kindle but not at original prices. Will use more for internet but also as reader. Not into games but would be fabulous for a youngster. Prime is great!

NYAmicas,5,Simple but does wonders,I saw that Best Buy had a great deal on this and I was looking for a smaller sized tablet for all the Kindle books I have bought or ordered. The item shipped pretty quickly and I did have issues setting it up but once I got through that I fell in love. I quickly downloaded my books to the Kindle and surfed online with ease. This was a great deal!

spudzpup,4,Good For The Cost,"The 7"" fire tab is a good buy for the money, especially if you got it when it was on sale for 35.00."
Ears,3,Screen resolution not good,For $50 i wasnt expecting high end screen resolution.
serinamarisa,3,Mom Bought As A Present,"My mom bought this for my sister, she loved it. Great gift!"

delvinsmells,5,Great Tablet!!,Bought it for my son as a replacement for his damaged tablet. What a great deal this is. I reccomend it fully.
flagatorfan,5,hard to believe!,"It is amazing that a quality tablet is this reasonable. I got a special price, but, even at $50, it's a deal. The down sides, not enough to rate it low, would be the apps are not Play Store, though the OS is android based. You may not find certain apps you want, but, there are many in the Amazon store to choose from. Also, the screen savers are ads, but you can pay $15 and Amazon will take them off."
Bitz,3,Good tablet for the price,"Decent performance but sometime do lag a bit, screen resolution is a bit low for someone coming from a Galaxy S6 and Note 7. But for $33 (got on a sale) you can't expect top end product. Installed Google Play Store without needing root, so I can share my normal adroid app even though this is running fire OS"
GeneralDeath2U,4,Great tablet,This tablet works just as well as the big name one at half the price

Boss,4,You can't get some Apps from Google App Store,Good devices except you can't find some apps you only can get it from Google Play Store instead of Amazon App Store. You have to learn how to side load apps if you want to install apps that you can't find from Amazon App Store.

Snowman16,4,Good buy for the price,This tablet was bought for my 3 year old. He loves it and it's great. There is one caveat though. It is loaded with ads. Everytime the tablet is turned on or screen locked there are amazon ads. Because of this I now have a new 250.00 vacuum that was accidentally ordered. So make sure 1 click buying is disab k ed
AzHuL,3,Decent,"Decent tabletPerforms ok You really get what you pay forDo not expect anything special with this tablet. It works. Does what its meant to do and nothing more. Having a Prime subscription is a must but not a requirement to take full advantage of this tablet. Its pretty much an Amazon Portal for all the services they offer. Great for my son streaming his shows like Sesame Street, PBS, etc Netflix works fine as well"
hotrodr24,4,my new shopping toy,enjoying this tablet. purchased so I could have a bigger screen for shopping when I don't wanna pull my laptop out. so far it is serving the purpose. didn't know it came in colors until I opened it.

Srikanthsegu,5,Useful product in less price,I am very happy to buy this product it's of vey less price and really useful for kids to learn new things
BobAtom,5,Top Value for the Money,"Originally purchased to practice rooting Android devices. Started using it and determined that I liked it so much I did not root it.It is by design and understandable and expected that it is tied to Amazon everything. Books, music, mp3 all are available through Amazon Underground. Not as many and maybe not your favorite apps are available but it is loaded with many offerings. NOTICE: by design, the tablet downloads and stores all files to an SD Card, if one is inserted. Solidly built, it will withstand child's play. The resolution is not super high but is very good for its size. I read using this tablet and the text is very clear. In fact, I use text readability as the test for evaluating a tablets resolution. After start up, you can go through simple process to connect this device with your Amazon account. This to allow purchases on the tablet. The parental controls are top notch. You can limit or allow as little or as much websites connections, limit purchases also. You can also load Google play on this tablet. With a little searching and downloading of files, you can download and play all Google Play Store Apps.-battery life is good.-speaker is good, single speaker only.-Blue Tooth connection easy. NOTE: if you have Sync (Microsoft) installed in your vehicle, the tablet will connect but has trouble reconnecting! It is Microsoft, what can you expect. You will have to unpair, delete from Sync then reconnect to get it to work in your vehicle.-I use this as my beater tablet for use outside as I do yard work, play music while in the shower (steamy environment), and when running around town. -It has 128GB SD Card expansionFor the money get more than one. I have 5 total and have given away several more as gifts."
Llb825,4,nice tablet,nice tablet for the price able to browse internet with ease
Korn,4,Just what we wanted,Great product and price service in the store could have been better
Bobbi,5,Kindle Fire,I purchased this on sale for about $38.Worth every penny and more! Not only do my regular Kindle books look awesome backlit but now I can by or checkout from the online library comics and graphic novels as well as tv episodes and movies. It looks great and (after a year or so) I will be ready to upgrade to HD.
GraceK,3,Kindle Fire,"Everyone knows ""kindle fire"". When these went on sale I grabbed a few up to use as kiosks for our PTA. Little did I know that fires run a ""special"" operating system, not a standard android. The 2 apps I needed to run were not available on kindle store. After much research I found a work around but it was very frustrating."
notthewife,5,This item is real nice for the price .,"This item is light downloads come in fast , built great and has a lot of bells and whistles too . Great for beginners and kids ."
pmonk,5,"Great Tablet, Great Value",Many features this tablet has and is a great price!

Woody,2,Very basic,I felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader
Gazza,5,"Simple, easy to use, does what it says on the box.","Unbelievably good value when I bought one at a discounted sale price, but well worth the usual Best Buy price of USD$50. Simplicity itself, particularly if you have used Android previously. Although restricted to the Amazon environment and App store, I still found all the free apps I could ever need, and the tablet appears to be very reliable compared to my aging nexus."
LUCKYMEN,4,Good for kids,Little bit slow but perfect fit for my 6years old daughter.
TIjuana,4,Good tablet for a beginner,I brought the tablet for my step mom who isn't very familiar with technology. It was easy for her to operate and a great price.
Kylerobey,4,Good for Netflix or Web,Streaming services run great. Multi-Tasking is terrible though. A lot of games aren't supported. Good for browsing the web and streaming only
Amg720,5,Fire Tablet,Great customer service. Very fast and accurate. I appreciate all the help.
Lilli,5,Tablet is great to take places.,"I got tired of lugging my laptop around everywhere. I asked my daughter-in-law how she like her tablet.

averagejoe,4,Good value,"For the price you have to deal with a lot of pre-loaded stuff, but it is a great price for a capable tablet."
averagejoe,4,Good buy to entertain kids on roadtrip.,"For the money it can do a lot, only downside is for the price to be so cheap it is pre-loaded with a LOT of stuff you don't want."
vuahai,5,Can't expect more for the price,"This tablet is not going to be a flagship tablet. Considering you're paying about 10% of the price of an iPad, this does more than 10% of what an iPad can do. Netflix, browsing, emails all work great! Can't complain."
Tomato,5,Great tablet,I bought this tablet for my son. It was reasonably priced and he loves it. Easy to carry around. He loves reading books on it
Enschi,5,great picture,"This is the third Vizio TV I've had, all still working, even after nine years of almost continuous service"

Betsy,5,9/9/2016,Good tablet for twin boys four yrs old. Don't have to worry about them dropping it too much. Easy set up.Would recommend.
Nick,4,Good for the price,"Overall it is hard to say this is a good Tablet just looking at it in a vacuum. That being said when you take the price into consideration, it is hard to say it's not a good value. The screen isn't very bright so outdoor use is difficult ( I wanted to use it as a screen for my drone but its not ideal), and it's locked down by the Amazon Echo System. It does work and it doesnt hiccup or struggle too much and again for the value especialyl when I bought it for $33 its hard to argue. It can also be hacked to install the Play Store on it which makes it even more of a value."
Harry,4,Good product,Its good product with the $ amount. I feel its little slow but okay.
Junebug,5,Super!,This little tablet is marvelous! I do not have a smart phone and this slips effortlessly in my handbag to be scanned at a store etc.. It's quick to respond and I can't say enough about it.

Longgone,5,Great Value and best Kindle Fire yet,I've bought nearly every model of Kindle Fire since they came out. I love the fact that this model allows the installation of a micro SD card for storage of photos and music. The color is also a plus! Much better than basic black. Glad I bought it!
ColonelCazual,5,Great basic tablet,"I picked this up Oma deal of the day. Took a little learning, but man is this thing great for travel! Does backlight reading and plays my digital movies. Great all around tablet!"

Dean,4,"After two weeks, I find the product outstanding.","The first of these failed after a week or so with lines in the screen. I took it back to BB and they replaced it with another. I was able to automatically reinstall everything I had on the first with no problem. I love this device. I bought it to download and read books from my library, but it does much more. It notifies me when I receive mail and I switch from a book to it and can read it on the device and then easily switch back. I can also do a lot of research that I normally do on my PC. I highly recommend it."

Patty,5,Love the Kindlefire,I am so happy with the Kindlefire. I bought the first generation Kindlefire & I was happy with it. When I bought this new Kindlefire I was happily & surprised at how much better this version is. I use the Kindlefire mainly for watching movies & reading books. So.happy with it :)
Kitamarie99,4,So far So good,I purchased this so that I could use Skype to check on my dogs during the day. I had to download an app that makes the Fire stay on otherwise it goes to sleep. Once I had that app installed and Skype doing the Auto-Answer it worked well. Overall if I was going to use this as a reader or mini tablet it looks like a good product. The screen is bright and sharp.

gopro1572,5,OMG,"OMG! This product is awesome. I never knew my children can be so quiet when they are playing or reading a book on this device. I love it and it makes them not want to play with your phone anymorte bc what thy find on your phone, they can find on this device. Thank you for this.They have learned a lot already and still learning. Recommended it to all my freinds with children already. Great for the price!"
Tuppz,4,"Does what it needs to, but don't expect much.","I primarily use this as a media tablet and it does it pretty well. The expandable storage is nice and it has around 6-7 hours of continuous local video play. Downsides to this product are the bad external speaker and limited apps available, but hey it's $50."
DebN,3,Amazon Fire 8 Gb,"We bought this for our 8 yr old daughter and it's great for most of what she does, but it is not good for playing a lot of games because it locks up sometimes or it runs a little slower. So if we had to do it again we'd probably buy something with a bigger processor."
gabby,5,I love it for kids,I have 2 of these one for each one of my kids I love it for kids the instead of buying something so expensive I chose this and the geek squad protection is awesome my son cracked the screen and they where just amazing and replaced it with a brand new one

Michelle,4,Great Tablet for the Price,I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend to use for Netflix and email responses (without breaking out his huge laptop). He loves the portability of the device. Just wish the apps were a bit more sophisticated in what you can get.
DarrenD,2,Based off of Chrome Cast,Could not get this to work with my chromecast so I returned it.
Aary,5,Great Tablet,I was looking for an affordable tablet for my kid. This was a great buy.
PrimoAir,4,Excellent for children,"I got this for my kids, we use the freeplay for $3 a month. We added a 16gb memory card. It is not an hd screen, but it still looks good. And it's faster than other quad core tablets, probably because it's not running heavy graphics. Great for casual use and children."
Macman,5,The Best Bargain Ever,"I bought one of these in December as an inexpensive back up for an iPad. I sincerely believe that the Fire 7"" tablet is the best bargain I have ever had in an electronic device. I now gift these to my elderly friends who need a simple internet connector."
Maelca,5,Great purchased,I bought it for my grandchildren and they are happy
Raul,4,good product,"It is the right size to throw into a purse because it is light weighteasy set up.

Kingskid1966,2,Disappointing,I purchased 3 kindles for my grandchildren for Christmas last year. I have been very disappointed with their quality. The chargers were very difficult to plug in right from the beginning and now one of the kindles won't even charge at all. The others have to be positioned just right or they won't charge either. I definitely would not recommend this particular model kindle to anyone.

Enzo,5,Great tablet for the price,Great little tablet to do what I need. I mostly just surf the web and definitely use it for Netflix and Amazon prime. Big enough to be comfortable and just relaxing watching your shows
Nanak,4,Good tablet,Battery wouldnt hold a charge but was able to get it teplaced.

zarm7,4,This is a nice tablet,I bought it for reading books. And it works very well for that purpose.

jim9er2003,5,Vary Good for the $$,Nice easy to use Tablet for a good price..........
Dave,4,Great Product for Kids,"I purchased this product for my ten year old daughter. She absolutely loves it! It was easy to use, simple to navigate, and even easier to set-up (especially all of the parental controls and such). I am able to manage her account online and limit her use and time on the tablet, as well as keep track of any purchases she may wish to make. It is a great starter tablet for a responsible youth."
Tglee,5,"Bargain price, not bargain quality!","Most tablets in this price range have the quality to show for it. That is not the case with this unit.While only $50, it feels more sturdy and acts more responsive and capable than other bargain tablets that fit into the same price range.The amazon app store has a lot of great options and the popular apps you would expect from apple or Googles app stores. The only downside is the navigation. Even then, it is only a personal problem as I am used to Google play.All in all, this is a great tablet at an even greater price!"
gmccrimon,5,All kindels are great,This is my second Kindel the old one gave out after many years of service
DukeofEarl,5,Great for playing,This is a great product. Suitable for all ages. I love using this because of the I find something new everytime I use this. I would grade this an a plus.

fan46,4,Easy to use,Great I like the size easy to take anywhere some times smaller is better
TheLaganator,5,Budget Tablet doesn't disappoint,"For the money, you really can't do much better in the tablet department. Quick, responsive and does everything you want it to do. Highly recommended"
Grimlock1986,5,Cheap tablet,Bought this for a plane ride to watch some YouTube's and Twitch streams. Would buy another.

SpikeyHead630,4,Awesome tablet for the kids,"This tablet proved to be an awesome gift for the kids! It doesn't have Instagram and runs a little off kilter sometimes, but good for the most part"
Ruthie,5,Handy extra computer and fun!,"I use the email, search, and read books primarily. My fingertips are still clumsy on the keyboard but will improve! I forget how to access some things but ask those who know. The Kindle Fire can do so many things for the modest price. I just need to keep at it!"
jwmurphy56,5,Value,The Kindle Fire is a great value doing most of what more expensive tablets do for a great price.
charley,5,Best tablet value,Bought this for my twelve year old grandson to replace his two year old Kindle Fire. He loved the blue color and said it was like his friends mini pad.
Maryann,5,Fire tablet,love the improvements they made on this fire kindle.
Gabby,4,"Loved it, lost it","My husband and I originally bought this for our 1 year old so she could be busy on our longer road trips however when it wasn't being used by her, we would listen to our audio books from audible and it was relaxing and provided good bonding moment . Unfortunately, I left it in the trunk of our rental car and when I called the dealership, they said they didn't find it.. we only had it for about a month!"
Prprincess4u2nv,3,An ok tablet.,This is a cheap tablet. I bought this so that my kids wouldn't ruin another IPad by crushing it. This tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again. If it doesn't have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it.
Joye,3,"Great e-reader, not so great as a tablet","I bought it as a replacement for a broken tablet. There are several apps I'd like to add to it that are not available, and it won't update the Facebook app so I wind up using my phone for many things that I used to do on my tablet. If it wasn't a good e reader, it would be worthless, but I do read on it a lot, so I'm keeping it but I would still like a new tablet - which is disappointing."
HankinCarlsbad,4,"Great tablet, great price","The 7"" screen is just right for size. Comes w/ plenty of extra goodies from Amazon and Audible, among others. The only complaint is the display in bright, direct sunlight requires adjustment to full bright, or I'd have given it 5 stars."
Aytch,4,Great Tablet For The Money!,Great little tablet for the money. Used some rewards certificates to pay for most of it. If I was to do it again I would buy the 16GB version. Very happy with the handy little tablet!

triciac12321,5,Great price,"I bought 2 of these because they were on sale for $33.33. I really like them, but the Kaspersky internet security that I received free for 6 months will not download onto the tablets. I am going to have to call the Geek Squad to fix this problem."

SweetTea,5,Amazing tool for web surfing,"We purchased the tablet for our mom's 63rd birthday and she loves it!!! She had absolutely no problems when it came to the initial setup. Our mom has been reading books, listening to music, ordering items through the mail and watching videos like a pro. We couldn't have gotten her a better gift!!!"

King,5,Good,Good tablet at a low price you should buy one now .
Harris,3,Like but missing a few things.,I like the tablet. Great price. But the charging cord is to short and there isn't an indicator light to inform you when the tablet is charging.
poohbutt25,5,great for people who dont want a laptop,This was a great buy it does everything a laptop or desk top without the big bulk.
DCR18,5,Excellent Price,"This is an excellent price for the Amazon Fire 7 Tab, I highly recommend to product!"
Sweetpea54,3,Freezes a lot when using it.,This tablet freezes a lot when using it. It started out working good and then it started freezing when playing games.
domiller0550,3,Just ok,I bought this hoping that I could use it for a book reader and other lightweight tasks. The wifi is very slow and the tablet in general is slow and hangs to much
Tami,5,Great tablet for adults and kids,I bought this tablet originally for my kids but I loved it so much I had to purchase one for myself. Love it!!
Nicolio2010,3,It's okay,I got it because I wanted to be able to use it to download books for college classes. It is slow and seems to freeze up a bit when I try to use it. I have a 64g memory card in it and have most of my stuff saved to it. I wouldn't think that would cause it to run slow.
Matt,5,Awesome,I bought for my daughter to keep her busy and it works great!
Grace,5,Great tablet for a six year old,"My niece loves this tablet. It did not take her very long to learn the apps, how to download apps, visit wifi and etc. Thanks"

James,4,Nice size takes very good pictures and video For,"For the price this is a great value, I considered a laptop, or larger tablets but am quite satisfied with this purchase"
davdvsqz,3,Not Bad For A 'Tablet',"Ok, so, I wanted an e-reader and had thought about just buying an iPad mini. I wish I had. Don't get me wrong, this tablet does the job it's meant to do but that's about it. If you're looking for a tablet that you can play games on, browse through Facebook or instagram on, or even surf the net then you're better off getting an upgraded version of this tablet or an iPad as I said before. Plus, this tablet comes packed with apps that are unnecessary and just plain memory wasteful. However, if you just need it to read your books or magazines then this is the perfect little companion for you. I'm saving for an iPad."
Xolo,3,Like the spikier,I had an insignia tablets before they are very low on saund

aubdaub,5,Awesome tablet,It does just what I need it to do! Easy to take on the go!
nPrime2000,5,Amazing value...,"...but mind the quality control. For $40 - $50, you get an amazingly capable tablet for media consumption. Streaming services, surfing, and reading are all handled perfectly fine, however, the tablet lacks the power to be a gaming platform.Please note, this is actually my 3rd tablet, as the first 2 were returned with the first being covered in dead pixels and the second having terrible light bleed. The 3rd looked and functioned perfectly. Bad batch? Who knows. But watch the quality control."
Vanessa,4,Great tablet for a beginner.,I purchased this tablet for my grandma and she was able to learn to use it right away. This is a great tablet for someone who is a beginner when it comes to technology.

IwasCold,3,Really annoying ads,"The price was low, but the ads are really annoying to me. The tablet is good, works well. Doesn't seem to be able to use apps from Google Play store which was a surprise and disappointment to me. All in all, I would've chosen another android tablet."
april1456,5,great product,"I was replacing a first generation kindle. I love the slim size and the improved access to the internet, amazon underground and my library. The ads do not bother me once I open my kindle"

MY DAD HAS BEEN USING THIS ITEM EVERYDAY SINCE HE GOT IT. I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT! ITS GREAT FOR THE PRICE AND WORKS WELL. MY MOM ALSO PURCHASED TWO OF THE SAME TABLETS FOR MY NEPHEWS."
Jess,5,Great for Kids,I got this tablet for my niece because while she was visiting with me her tablet that she brought with her stopped working. I got online and searched for an inexpensive tablet that would do the same thing that her non working tablet would do and so I searched and ran upon this tablet and this is it plus more!!!!
Betsy,5,Excellent.,8/18/16Love the product & price.Would recommend.Customer.
DoubleDekker,4,Affordable ereader,We wanted something simple reader for our kids. My only complaint are the ads.
bulldogfan,4,Hooked on reading books online,I am really enjoying being able to read books online that are downloaded from the public library. I have read 5 books in the last few weeks now that I can use the public library system to access book titles. No more buying books at the bookstore
Techlove,4,Decent tablet for kids,"Got this for my 7 year old because of the parental controls I heard about. So far it's been a decent tablet and has some nice controls, but it would be better if the controls could be customized by day and specific apps instead of all apps and by weekday/weekend."
kind,5,this tablet is just what I needed.,"Simple tablets and I get along great! I don't want to spend the big buck to get someting that a much cheaper alternative will handle just as well. Gave my much older tablet to a child, who was overjoyed, and updated version for me."
PopT,5,Versatile tablet,"Purchased this tablet at a great price! This tablet works very well within the amazon ecosystem, so it is best geared towards those with amazon prime. It has micro sd card slot which is a plus."

tothepoint,5,Great for the price,Bought this for basic web browsing and low-requirement games. Serves purpose at a cheap price and has good quality and help support.
Iceburg,5,Great for the kids and adults,"Bought this for my daughter (7 yrs), and ended up getting a second one for my son. I do wish Best Buy sold the kid-proof cases, but meh.The tablet is quick, the memory is expandable as well, which is what keeps me from anything iWhatever. Throw a 64GB card in this and your kid can make videos on Musical.ly all dang day and become a YouTube sensation (still waiting on that check).PARENTAL NOTE: If you go this route, take advantage of Amazon's FreeTime. It's fantastic, customizable, safe and easy to stay hands-off. I use it with both tablets with both kids. Time limits, no questionable content (depending on what you call questionable; i hate KidzBop) and excellent apps, etc included.Tablet is more than powerful enough for adulting, too, so if you despise kids, you can still enjoy your lonely, hollow, selfish existence with this outstanding tablet."
GrannyGeek,5,Great tablet for ebooks and audio books,"I bought on sale for $35. My sister recommended Kindle tablets because of the text to speech feature. Some kindle ebooks have a text to speech feature. You can start reading at home then turn on text to speech fir when you are in the car stuck in traffic. We have a prime membership and you can save Amazon videos to watch offline. I haven't tried this yet but sounds great for plane or bus travel. You camn download the Overdrive app directly for free books, audio books,and video. I plan to download the Nook app so I can read Overdrive magazines and my Nook books. Micro sd slot for additional storage. Only mono sound which is fine for what I want to use it for. Cheap enough that I'll let the grandkids use it."
AvidReader,4,Affordable Tablet,"Affordable and convenient device for watching video, reading, kid's light gaming and browsing the Web."
hemant,5,Good,good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.
Irispipo,5,love it,Went from nook to Kindle . Love it. Awesome item. Love it
nanduedi,3,Nice tablet for the price,Look was good and very comfortable for reading. If allowed to install android store that would be really awesome.
lavictoria,4,Very Good For Kids,"We bought this tablet right before a trip out-of-town, and it was a good purchase. Eight-year-olds crave entertainment, and the Amazon Fire gives plenty of that.It's been easy to handle, and hasn't had any issues breaking down.The charger cable is a pain to plug into the tablet (only the part that fits into the tablet itself), and some of the tablet versions of apps like Neko Atsume aren't good compared to the phone versions, but we are overall very happy with our purchase."
Steve,5,Great tablet for the money.,Bought it for my son for Christmas and he uses it all the time. Great product for the price.
adttac,5,perfect for my kids,My kids love their kindle. Its the perfect tablet for adults and kids to share.

SeanS,4,Solid tablet,"I give away these tablets at events. They are well priced, hard to break and efficient tablets. A great buy for the money."
RonT,5,Great replacement kindle,New OS 5 performs better than expected. No hanging screens and increased caching enables better video streaming. I purchased this as a replacement for an older model that my son broke - would definitely buy again.
devang,5,great tablet!,Bought it as a birthday present for my son and he loves it. Easy to use and works fast.
OsZy14,5,Awesome,This tablet is Affordible and supper useful! If your am Amazon kinda person I definitely recommend this

Adee,4,Great quality for the price!,"I love the size of this, it's the size of a book! The only thing I don't like is the lock screen has ads."
Oliver,5,Very useful to my Autistic daughter,I bought the Fire for myself and it is user friendly. We put some games on it about 1 yr later for my daughter and she actually can navigate it pretty good. So we bought her her own Fire which she is proud to be able to listen to music and play simple games.
Gaga,5,Great tablet for a second grader,My grandson is really enjoying this product and it is standing up well to his use
Cyndy,4,Wonderful for reading and playing,Works great as an ereader. Can hold so many books!
Markoni1,3,"Great tablet, but a little slow","I really like the features, the size, and the price, but I was a bit disappointed with the lack of speed!"
BanjoLady,4,Serves its purpose,I got it when my computer broke. Will get a laptop later.
sprite,4,Wonderful product for young children and portable,I bought this for my niece .It is user friendly and easy to carry. The features allow her to explore and use her imagination and of course the price was right.
Line,4,Great,"Works great as an e-reader, lots of apps and is Good for basic web browsing."
Protector65,2,Pictute quality and performance low,"I have had several kindles, this latest one just doesnt seem to be as good of quality as the previous onrs i have owned"
Tito,5,Great Tablet,This is a very good tablet to have for reading or playing games.
Jorge,5,Fire Tablet,Great tablet for kids! Both of my children love it!
Graybird,3,Nice economical buy for very young kids (under 10),"Bought for very young grandkids. You get what you pay for. A little slow. Good for watching things like Netflix and playing games and JWBroadcasting. Navigation okay. Not great. Kids are usually hard on anything, so if it gets broken, ok. But no problems so far and the kids like it. Would never buy for myself, or anyone over 10."
FLMOM,5,Read books for a great price,Wanted a small kindle to read books and keep kids busy with games while on vacation. Great price and size. Small enough to carry in your purse or even pocket.
brianward317,5,Great tablet for price,"Great tablet for price. Highly recommended, quick and easy to use."
rickynsandi,5,Great tablet for anyone,It's a great tablet for a beginner or for anyone that has or had a sumsung phone : }
Jake007,4,Great tablet for my children,Easy to use and set up to get started. Set's up for both of my children
JMaher,4,Yes!,"I was looking for a tablet that will function well for basic web browsing and video playback as a gift for my mom. I initially purchased a Best Buy exclusive tablet that had a slightly larger screen and more memory than this Fire tablet, but it wouldn't comnect to wifi at all and took forever to load to home screen when powering on. Returned it and got this Fire and am so pleased. It does what I want it to do, although we don't use the Amazon extras lol. I just wish the screen size was a bit larger. This connects to wifi well. It does have a couple dead pixels that is really only noticeable when it displays what should be an entirely black image, but does not deter from our enjoyment of this product."
winner,5,Good for kids,Excellent for small task and gaming for all ages .
Notvern,4,Great little tablet!,"I'm liking this tablet more and more, the more I use it. Great battery life. Easy to use."
Selena,5,The kindle is great!,The kindle is great! Great product and great price.
Monkey2013,5,Best thing I have ever purchased from Best Buy,I love my Kindle Fire!!! Except for making telephone calls I can do so much. I specifically purchased my Fire because I knew I was going to be in the hospital for awhile. I am now reading my 3rd EBook that I borrowed from my local library.
jallen344,5,great tablet!,"Great bare bones tablet! Great for e book reading! Also, can't beat the price!! no complaints here!"
Darrel,3,Impulse buy,Good for the price. Low memory but good descent graphics easy to use
Buyer,5,Great for the price.,The kindle was bought for my grandchildren that also have iPads. I don't have to worry so much about them breaking it and being out all the money for an iPad.
Backup,5,Perfect for my 11 year son,"This is a great tablet for my young son, he is able to order books for school. He plays games and he is able to go onto youtube for the fraction of an Ipad. It is great!!!"
MinecraftSweeper,4,Nice All Arround Tablet,Currently this is the fifth version of the Kindle Fire that I purchased since they came out. Purchased this one due to its ability to maximize storage with a SD card unlike the other ones I have. It seemed to not run as smooth as my Kindle Fire HDX once I started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since I use other tablets for that. This was mainly purchased to download shows and movies from Amazon Prime to watch offline.
wolfy1,4,A good starting tablet.,My computer crashed and I bought this tablet to get me by during repairs. The tablet allowed me to keep up with my e-mails and events. I used it to surf the internet as well. It will be used for similar purposes when my wife and I go on a three week road trip in the near future. A very compact and versatile unit.
Jacky,4,Good product,This e reader is very excellent.The screen is a bit small but you can accommodate.
Allycat,4,The amazon fire tablet is a good.,I like playing the games on it and doing email and music that I can listen too.
ETAPRIME,5,Great price,Good tablet for the price works like it should with good battery life
Ajn3344,4,Super easy and kid friendly,The fire is one of the easiest E readers/tablets to use. The Amazon interface makes it a true treasure.
MeganP,5,Great for kids too,I purchased this for my 7yr old who loves reading but also loves the apps and games available. This has a fast load time and I recommend a SD card to go with it. We needed it after a few days of downloading books and apps.
Coog99,5,Awesome starter tablet,"My 8 year old son saved up his allowance money in order to buy this tablet. He did all of the research himself and decided that based on the price and the features that this was the tablet for him. He can connect to our home Wi Fi to access the internet, You Tube and games. We monitor what he is accessing for safety purposes. This is much smaller than an iPad, but is very mobile and easy for kids to use. I bought a case for it to protect it from drops and allows my son to work from multiple angles on the tablet."
foxtrtr,3,Ok tablet,"If you're just going to read and play a game or two, maybe surf the internet a bit, this is an ok tablet. But if you are a heavy user, I'd tell you to pass on this tablet because it won't keep up with your surfing/games/e-mail."
Pika,4,Great tablet for a beginner,Easy to use and has some great features. Useful for both kids and adults
Blair01,5,Easy to use,Grandkids love it! It's very easy for them to use. They enjoy reading and playing games!!!
SammyB,5,I am loving it,I am not a savvy table user. I actually don't like tablets to start with. I prefer my convertible Windows 10 laptop but there is a Bible app called youversion that is very useful to me and my iPhone screen is too small and my laptop is too big to carry to Church so this tablet is perfect for me. Coupled with a leather case it is easier to hold and enjoyable to use. I got it on sale from Best Buy for $33 + tax. It is a great deal at this incredible price.
AppleMomma,3,Ok Tablet,"This is an ok tablet. We bought it thinking it would be good for travels with our little one, but it's not what we expected. Our little one is able to exit out of movies and apps. There is no way to lock the app when it is in use with little ones. This would be a good tablet for a teenager or adult who wants a tablet but doesn't want to spend a lot of money."
Morris,5,Very good and easy to operate for kids.,The product is good and easy to operate. I guarantee that you won't regret buying it.
Edrick,3,Great for regular Amazon users,This product is fast a stylish. Good battery life. Helps to be a regular Amazon client.
Arman,5,Great for kids,Easy to use and great for the kids. Lightweight and easy to travel with.
Adam,5,Good Little Reader,It does exactly what it says for the right price..
Shreetanu,4,for kids and entry level,"great tablet for kids but a lot of ads , for someone who wants a cheap tablet that more or less can do all stuff this is a good choice"
birdsonabat,4,Replacement for kindle paperwhite,So far I like the backlit feature. I felt the price was affordable. The battery life is not as long as my previous Kindle but it does a lot more so that is to be expected.
Djpeefunk,5,Awesome,Great tablet and very easy to use. Also good battery life.
murad,4,good,it is good product.i like best buy.Excellent service.
Duchess,4,good tablet,"The Kindle Fire 7"" so far works well after about 6 weeks of daily use. The battery life is a bit disappointing - four hours or less. I bought this to replace my Kindle e-reader because it was for sale at a very good price. But, it functions much better as a basic tablet. I don't like reading for long periods with this screen. Sad to see my keyboard e-reader die, but these electronics don't last forever."
GTown619,3,Still learning how to use it,I'm still learning how to use it. I like that it is small enough to put in my purse.
er4nsa,4,Not the newest; but still a contender,"Great companion to any laptop, and an excellent reader+. Amazon Prime membership can enhance the overall ease of use."
trinibabe,4,great tablet,I was a little worried at first because I brought the tablet for my 7 year old but so far I have no complaints
Posey,3,Great tablet for books plus more!!,I love reading books on here. Playing games are also nice for the kids with the free time kid app. Only thing I don't like is the sound is not very loud. If the sound was louder it would get a 5 star rating.
ShannonG3160,4,Wonderful tablet,Wonderful and fast little tablet. It already servesany uses...
Christiana,5,this gadget cost only 49 dollars but very g,This kindle fire 5th generation 7inches is a very good product.it works well.and best buy customer service was so helpful.
Fabi,5,Great apps,I love it because it is functional and complete for I needed.
Bev2016,3,gifts,gave to daughter and son. they are enjoying them very much
Ronniek,5,Great tablet for kids or entry level adult,Heck fifty bucks for a tablet a name brand tablet that feels premium not bad for the money!
Doll,4,Great for my kids,I like the size and it's user friendly. I originally bought a tablet that was bigger but it stopped working less than a year and the size was too big and too heavy for my 7 year old. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
Nikki,2,It's ok,I love dis tablet just wish the screen wasn't crack!
PaulC,4,Great for kids.,Product works well and is durable. Great for kids.
111elite,5,great for the price,"This item is ideal for kids to play games and a whole lot more.,my hubby even have one and he enjoys his and I love the picture quality."
Gemmiestar,5,"Nice Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet","I gave this Fire 7"" tablet five stars because of the price and quality. You won't find another for the price with so many good features. I purchased it primarily for reading books from Amazon and my library. The screen is excellent. This tablet can enlarge the size for best reading comfort. The sound is very good and it's best when connecting to a set of speakers. There's an advertisement when first logging on, which is not too annoying, (to pay $15 to remove). It's great for beginners and anyone who wants a light, compact tablet to carry around. I also have a 10"" Samsung, but this was difficult and heavy to hold while reading. I also purchased a case to protect the Fire 7"". It makes holding the tablet easier. I can't say enough good things about this tablet. The screen, sound and speed while browsing the internet are very good These were most important to me. I highly recommend the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet."
LearningNewThings,5,I am enjoying this tablet,"This tablet is great for beginners like myself, I haven't done much more than check emails and read articles but there is more to learn and do"
torbuc,5,good tablet for kids,kids love the tablet & the picture quality is good
Coach,4,Great device for my kids,My kids love using this device it is perfect for playing games and watching shows
SamottaWiggins,4,A Best Buy at the time,"Really good and solid tablet, especially for kids. Highly recommend that you buy the case that goes with it too."
HARRY,5,Great product,Its a great worth of the money spent on it. Good for reading
Vlad,5,Best tablet for the price,This is a great tablet for what it costs. I mostly just surf the web on it a bit but I also watch netflix and espn type streaming apps sometimes and it works great for that too.
mindboy,5,Great for kids,This was a great tablet for a child and even adults.
Jordan,4,Great value for the money!,"I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own ""Silk Browser,"" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon's OS, but it should not take very long to do so."
Fred,4,Great Little Tablet,"For reading, games, facebook, twitter, minor surfing the internet, this is a great device. It is small, but not so small as to be difficult to read. Fairly quick and dependable. For the price, it is hard to beat."
Nibs,5,Excellent tablet,I love my Kindle. I like the fact that I can read books or go onto the Internet to look up my news. Definitely can not beat the low price for everything it does.
KING,4,This is a great tablet for anyone to use,This is a great tablet for anyone to use. This is a wonderful product to purchase.
motakhim,5,Great Tablet,Works fine as advertised. Will recommend it to anyone.
Memnoch2015,4,Good tablet for under 40 dollars (on sale),"Bought this as a gift for my friends daughter, Works really well, good tablet for about 40 dollars. I did opt for the 2 year protection, Just in case something happens in the 2 years."
Jcon294,5,Great Tablet,Not a bad tablet if u like reading. If u prefer AOSP and customs Android OSes I suggest the Nexus 7
SLL2004,5,Great Tablet,"Love having the Amazon Fire, are able to download apps, watch videos from Amazon Prime, and it includes profiles so kids can have access to it as well. Highly recommend!"
heather,5,Great for my 10 yr old.,Easy to use with all the functionality she needs. Perfect size for her little hands
Moose27,5,Great tablet for the cost,We love this tablet and I bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter. She's able to use it with no problems.
RedCherry,5,Excellent tablet for the price,"Good tablet for browsing, watching videos and playing games.Totally worth the price."
Zoel,4,Amazon Fire,"Great product, good size for travel. We bought it for our girl, we use it when we travel, and put it on the back seat, so she can see videos or movies"
Bella,5,Great tablet for kids,"I bought the Amazon Fire for my daughter for her 8th birthday. It was decently priced. I can set parental settings and a curfew. I have to confirm what she wants to download. She loves it and plays games, listens to music, and reads books on it."
JOHNNY,5,Great for kids,My children love this. Cant beat the price. Need one more for myself.
Beli,5,My children just love this tablet,This tablet is mainly use for my children I highly recommend it
prettykitty1,5,Great value,Great value for the price. The kid loves it and compact so it travels well.
Hrd2stp,4,Gift for girlfriend,Good tablet for Facebook and games. Clean quick and she says it ok..ehhh
Hfgtr123,4,Nice tablet for kids,My son love it can't do anything without his Amazon fire on his hand.
dcjim2,5,Replacement for a Nook,"My wife had a Nook that she loved, but it broke. The least expensive ones are more than I wanted to spend and I came across the Fire. Excellent price for a Android based tablet (with the Fire OS) and reader. With a simple 'hack' you can install the Nook app so you can keep any previous Nook books as well as using the Amazon book store. She loves it! Being Prime members, she also uses it for video."
fierceblaze,5,"Different than I expected, but great.","It's a little different than most android devices but compatible with them. It was a very small (tiny) learning curve but if you are like me and using Amazon services like Kindle, Music, Audible or Prime then obviously the Amazon Kindle Fire was MADE with you in mind. Amazon Underground is great for kids as it's offering games that are otherwise paid or have in app purchases for the incredible price of absolutely free. It is amazing I don't know how they do that. I have a collection of games that would have cost me hundreds on my ipad. And there is the problem. You are going to have to buy one of these for you kids when they find out. Or you can install Amazon Underground on their own Android device."
Maried,5,Kindle Fire 7,"Bought this for my husband primarily so he could get the Wall Street Journal. It works great and he loves that it holds a charge, nice size, durable, great resolution, etc. it turned out to be a great gift!"
Lilmouse2134,4,Great Value for kids!,"This tablet is technically my 3rd tablet. I always look for something cheap, and useful. I also am always looking for tablets that I know I can easily replace without cringing, if my son destroys them. This tablet has been the best so far. I love the limitation I can place for my son's usage, and the fact I can specify on what they can spend time on! Battery time is really good, I usually have to charge it every other day, even after heavy usage it does take a while before it needs to be charged. Wish there was more apps, and I have had issue with certain apps, but it may just be those developers issues and not the tablet itself."
calliecat,5,Great Reader,"Love it. Use it everyday, and enjoy the books I have read on it."
Geno,5,Great for my 2 yr old with all the learning games,"My kid loves her new ""phone"" as she calls it. Clear picture and it is fast as well. Great item for the money!"
staples0829,5,nice tablet for my teenage grandson,we have had kindle for a while in our family so it just seemed natural to stick with it for my grandson's birthday gift.
MmphzTN,5,Great for kids,My son loves the kindle we got for him. It's perfect for the little guys to watch Netflix on.
OsirisAD,4,Great buy for the price and what it is,"Solid unit for reading and the occasional TV show or game.Those coming from a full featured tablet may find themselves frustrated at some of the limitations and quirks of Amazon's walled garden, but if your are looking for something cheap they does what it says on the box, you can't go wrong."
Wagsoma,5,"A gift for my husband , it is his third one.",My husband is an avid reader and what better way to reward him for his love of reading(and playing games lol)
xWisc,5,Perfect for traveling,"Great basic features - e-mail, web access, etc. Highly portable"
William,5,Works like a charm,Just as good as amazon suggests it to work. I use ut every day
Indy,4,"Good display, nice size.",Size makes tablet easy to take with but still large enough to be easy to see.
Indy,4,Great gift for avid reader,"Very happy with the tablet. Nice, portable size with good display."
TGLee,5,Great bargain tablet,"I purchased three of these tablets to give away at work. So, while I don't have any firsthand experience, I have asked my team how they liked them.It uses the Amazon app store (of course), which is fine but doesn't even compare to the Google Play store. Even though, there are a lot of options and most big apps (Netflix, hulu, etc.) are all supported.There is also removable storage. It is very nice to be able to add a memory card to expand your memory. This is a feature a lot of tablets stopped offering.All in all, these tablets are in expensive but more reliable and sturdy than other knock off tablets from different brands. Amazon made a great bargain tablet."
ronniek,5,great tablet for the money,cant beat this tablet for 50 bucks great present for anyone
ladydi,4,"good color, good buy","my grandson love it, he play with it all the time love it."
PIet,5,Surprisingly good.,"Bought this ""cheap"" tablet not expecting much. This thing blows away many of the more expensive android tablets. The Amazon system within the android system works great and filters out many of the android bugs that plague most tablets. Perfect for kids and the ""I just want it to work"" crowd."
Roman,4,Great product,"If you love to read this is a must. Only thing that I don't like is all the ads that pop up, when the wi-fi is open"
Zayda2016,5,Great for kids!,"My son who is eight loves this tablet. Great for road trips and really works for the price. Hey let's be honest kids need something to keep them busy, this works fast, easy to start up."

Karter,5,Great for teaching child to maneuver tableta,"My child loves his table. Educational material have been downloaded and he has learned his alphabets, how to spell color words, phone to sounds and is beginning to write at the age of three."
vish,4,Good,Very good tablet for a beginner. Very easy to use. However wished the color on the screen was better.
bendeho,4,Good tablet for beginner.,Bought it for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loves it.
Avinash,5,great tab,"Good Tablet for Kids, easy to operate and to handle."
Mike,5,Excellent price,"Easy to setup, more than acceptable performnces. I use the device to check emails, play, surfing the web and I never have any problems.Excellent price."
JoeV,5,one of the best options out there,For the price is the go to android tablet. And for a kid is the best first time tablet for sure
MoeMoe,5,Great tablet,A well worth it purchase. No complaints. Couldn't be happier.
Vikster,5,Perfect for protection,"Bought it for 2nd twin's BD (age 14), after he requested one. He has broken a screen to a different PAD; it slipped out of the car on to the ground, when he opened the door. He said, ""I wouldn't do it--but I am sure that it wouldn't break, if I threw it down on the ground"" just as the packaging said!"
Annan,4,Easy to use,I got this kindle after the kids had been at their grandma's around tons of iPads. They were just as happy with these...
LOLASMOM,4,"GREAT GADGET, especially for travel!","I had an I pad and replaced it with a MACAIR. However it is heavy and when i travel, I don;t feel like logging it along! So for $49, I thought ""HOW CAN I LOSE""? SO I bought it and I love it! The only thing I dislike are the ads that keep popping up for me to buy stuff. I am not sure it can be turned off. Other than that- NO COMPLAINTS!"
stan,5,Really enjoy this product,"I was not expecting much with this product, but man I was surprised how well it worked. I added the charter app and I am able to watch live tv on it."
Elvis,2,Good,"Not as good as i though, but at least it does what it is suppoused. Very bad screen quality"
Vikster,5,Grandsons love them.,"For the price, they are highly functional. Bought one for one grandson--his twin didn't think that was what he wanted for his BD, but a week later requested one1"
Djean,2,Not for those who wants to read free ePub books,"I bought this tablet to read Free Epub books that I have, but it didn't allow me to even look for the books, so I have it returned and exchanged for a cheaper one that still does a better job for those who wants to read free Epub books"
javii192,5,Good TABLET,THIS TABLET IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. ABLE TO PLAY GAMES WATCH VIDEOS AND USE THE INTERNET. ITS GREAT FOR KIDS AS WELL
remme00,4,Great tablet for starters.,"This is a great little tablet for people who want to learn more of the modern world. Simple programs, easy hook up to wifi and an easy touch screen. The only down side is the lack of memory, which is ok since this is my kids first tablet."
Kate,5,Affordable,Kindles are great as long as your not expecting a tablet that's top of the line. So far no problems.
ellisonh,5,Great Tablet for the money!!,This is the BEST tablet for the money anywhere on the planet!!
Cezzee,4,Very compact,"This is just the right size for someone who doesn't want to always use their phone while on the go. Must have wifi but that's not a problem. The response to the touch isn't bad at all. It isn't an iPad but it does the job fo rmusic, books, youtube, facebook and other small applications."
gunmetal,5,Better than the first generation,I had a 1st gen fire. Battery started getting week after 4 years. Bought this as a replacement. I like the expandable SD slot and the camera. Much better than the first at 20% of the price.
FMOM,4,Great tablet for kids,I bought this tablet for my 6 year old for his birthday because he chose it when we went shopping for a tablet. He loves it and it is easy to use
Joey,5,Great item!,"Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. Works great. She's dropped it several times and it just keeps on working! No issues at all."

DAYHAN,5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND PRICE,EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND THE PRICE IS EXEPTIONAL.THE UNITS IN STOCK AND GRATE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE.
JWag,5,Love this tablet.,Extremely simple to use upon powering the device up. Within a few minutes I synced my audio books & interfaced my email accounts in under 10 minutes. I'd definitely recommend this tablet.
DuvalStGirl,4,Inexpensive tablet for anyone!,"Purchased for a travel tablet for my niece. This was great! able to play amazon music, download a few books and movies, and we were off! I was not planning on this being a primary tablet, but it certainly did the trick for our trip and kept her occupied (even in traffic) for a 4 hour car ride. I am enjoying it for books as well."
Donna,4,Great camera for a little person,The kids program option are great. Don't like that I have to register tablet in order to buy anything though.
Steve01960,1,Worst tablet we found,"Bought this for our daughter to use, but nothing worked right and was difficult to use. It's a fairly cheap $$ product, and it shows. Ended up returning it and buying a Samsung the next day."
SuperDook,4,"Decent tablet good price, one issue",Starting with the issue. This is the cheaper version because it had ads. If you want to remove the ads it will cost you $15. This might be stayed in the fine print but this is not mentioned or brought up by the salesman.
bsterrn,4,Great for my daughter,Perfect for what my 8 year old uses this for. Watching programs and playing learning games.
Andymoog,3,Cheap tablet,You get what you pay for. It's $50 and that's about the quality you get. Overall works great but slow and crashes occasionally. Not the best battery.
Chopper13,5,Love it,Great product and works very well with no buffering on wifi.
newnatll,5,Works well for what I needed it for,Bought this item for my son because the last one needed replacing. Easy to use to read books and do internet searches.

Goodbuy711,5,Love my tablet,I love my tablet it is great for reading books and also playing games
dkz3r0,2,Android-lite,"I use this to read things and purchase items on Amazon. It doesn't play all of my favorite games from the App Store, nor does it sync to my android projector, so I don't really get full use of the larger screen. I think for my uses, I should've just purchased the e-ink version or maybe a full-android version."
JAPOK,5,great tablet,I purchased these as door prizes and they are always loved to those who win!
cjk0302,5,Works well,Bought these for my kids and wife. Kids love it and wife like sit as well. Wish it had Google play store though.

samiam,4,good,I am enjoying this product very much. great buy!!!
Chromebookuser,4,Very good for the price,"Surprisingly good and useful for the price. You really can't beat a $50 tablet. But remember, it still is a budget tablet. Tip: Adding anti-glare matte screen protector will great improve user experience and your interaction between finger and screen surface. Just like other budget tablets, Kindle Fire 7 lacks that coating finish on screen surface which will cause screen to attract smudges more than tablets with that coating."
Angel,4,Great deal fit a good tablet,This is a nice tablet useful on the go and I love it
JerseyDave,5,Nice Price,I think my Aunt likes her new toy. It is Amazing how technology marches on. This unit is perfect as an introduction to the tablet for people. Even if you have other tablets this is a wonderful addition because you can take it with you as if it's a throwaway. It has the slot to expand memory and the headphone jack has plenty of power and quality sound. It supports Bluetooth audio also. Any gadget freak should add this to their collection.
Taya,5,My Nephew's Birthday,It was for my nephew for his birthday and he loved it. So that's my review. If you decide to buy a Amazon Fire for someone's birthday or Christmas they will love it.

Nkm225,5,Great for kids,Great tablet for kids but you have to keep your eye on them to protect them
njmom76,5,Perfect for my needs,"How can you go wrong? $40 for a tablet that you can use as an E-reader, to check social media, to play games on? Small enough to fit in your purse? Surf the web? And it's pretty fast. I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for an affordable tablet to use for basic things or for children who are rough on their toys. I plan to buy one of these for my mother who has an older iPad that is awfully slow."

stepdad,4,"Good & Sturdy, Ads all over the place","I like the tablet, its fast enough for my daughter and would like it more without the ads or constant 'buy buy BUY!' taste I get while using it. Free underground apps are nice, my preference is plain jane android so I can control it. Do like the limit kids account I was able to setup so she doesnt change all the settings."
Kats,4,A good product,"This Amazon Fire has some nice features that my old Kindle Fire HD did not, like a camera and microphone for video chat. I wish that its keypad would do swiping, though. I miss that and am not as happy with the autofill on this model. Overall, though, it operates well. The browser could be a little faster."

Jessica,5,Great tablet for the price!!,This is a great alternative to an iPad especially for the price!! I would definitely recommend!!
Momof3,4,Battery life could be better,Great overall. Easy to use and navigate on. Charge the battery fully and it doesn't last long. Only used for nightly reading mostly and the battery needs to be charged daily. Not thrilled about that

carole2d,5,gift,"I bought this for my granddaughter because it was small enough to be carried around, big enough for her to read books on and her favorite color.It is sturdy in case she drops it.

Dan713,5,Great inexpensive disposable tablet,"This is a great inexpensive disposable tablet. It does run on Amazon's Fire OS which is based on android and designed for Amazon's app store. Technically you can side load it with other Android apps to get around some of the restrictions/limitations should you desire. If you are a big Amazon Prime fan (often using Amazon video/music, doing Amazon shopping), or need an inexpensive yet still very functional tablet then just get it. For the price, you can't beat it. If you are expecting a big major functioning tablet that uses the Google Play store or is comparable to an Apple iPad that is 6x the price, then this is not for you but you won't find that in this price range."

maz94protege,5,Best Value in a Small Tablet,"Picked this up for my wife, Wanted a spare tablet for watching some random shows and do some book rentals/reading from Amazon. $49.99 is a price that can't be beat, wish i would of picked it up on Black Friday as it was only $34.99.The Tablet has a single speaker, its loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room, also has a 3.5mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphones, or use Bluetooth.Screen resolution is very good for a budget 7"" screen. Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music. Camera on the Fire Tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto upload/backup to your amazon cloud drive. Also comes with a trial of Amazon PRIME.Would definitely buy again."

David,3,Good cheap tablet with less than stunning display,"Got the nieces, wife, and myself these for Christmas. Figures they were cheap enough, so why not.These are functional tablets in every way. We haven't found any problem with them. The display isn't a hi resolution, so I wasn't expecting great. I've had phones and tablet with the same resolution, but never one that looked quite as lack luster as this display. They are OK for the kids to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had. This one probably wont last much longer, but it's cheap. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and gotten better ones for my wife and I, though.If you want a disposable tablet or color reader for magazines and such, you'll probably be OK with this.If you want a good tablet, think about buying a good tablet."

I own two iPad Minis, and I must say that while this is not quite as exotic as the Mini, the price makes it the better value hands down. One key feature is that it has a micro SD slot, which allows you to instantly increase storage capacity (up to 128GB, I believe). This makes it very capable of managing large amounts of photos & videos."
Tj190,2,Okay,This table is okay for me. But it is great for kids
SGTED,5,Great for kids,Me and my Boyfriend naught this for his niece so she could play games on it. She liked being able to have us download games to help her spell on it v
Music40,5,HD Fire Kindle,"I bought this item for my husband for Christmas. We were wondering if he would really like it as he usually just likes to read actual books, but he immediately loved it. It's very user friendly and he has enjoyed getting to know all the ins and outs of it. It is a great way to read a book, but it has so many other uses too. I'm very glad I purchased this item. It's proven to be an excellent purchase."
Karl,5,Good Value,"I am enjoying this tablet. I'm sure there are more advanced tablets available but with the price and the certificate it was practically free. This is my first electronic item with a touch screen and its fun. I'm still learning how to use all the features. I would recommend it to a friend but I think its already being replaced with the next generation 8"""
Sarahlee116,5,Great tablet/ereader!,I bought this tablet for my daughter and I love the parental control features! The tablet works wonderfully with excellent memory for storage!
cicamo,5,Kindle Fire - great for multiple uses,"I bought the Kindle Fire mostly for use as an MP3. As a Black Friday deal of only $24.99, couldn't beat it. So far, it is working great as an MP3. I was able to download songs and playlists from my computer. Purchasing games and books have also been easy."
Dougee,5,Great for traveling !,My wife purchashed this. It will be perfect for traveling...read books...check e mail ..... surf the web.
Kelsey,4,"Great tablet for reading, games, and internet.","The kindle is great for general, all-purpose use of a tablet/e-reader."

rozay2k,5,FIRRRREEEE!!!,AWESOME LIL TABLET I BOUT THIS FOR A CO WORKER AND THEY LOVE IT
Reevesdavis,5,Excellent Tablet for the Money,"I am loving this tablet. I bought it during the Black Friday special just to check it out. Ended up buying a second one for my 3 yr old. Now that I know how good they are, I would not hesitate to purchase one at full price. I use it daily for my email, games and web surfing. I have also listened to music, read a couple of books and watched videos. I will say that you do need to remember that it is a $50 tablet, so don't expect to get $200 worth of tablet! But keep your expectations realistic and you will not be disappointed."
Mahesh,4,Great tab for beginners,Amazon fire tab is good for begineers or for kids. Memory and disk gets occupied soon. Suitable for fewer apps.

geog,3,Its ok for money. But it is heavily advertised,Its ok for price point but it is heavily advertised to manipulate you to purchase more from amazon.
Alex,5,Wow,For all it can do at this price level is amazing. Makes great gift too
dmoneyz,5,Kids use and video chat,"Bought it for kids to play with and not have to worry about kids breaking it since the price is okay. Also use it as a mean to do video chat. OK video quality, not too bad."
KatyS,5,Nice updates from the old kindle 7,"I've had the old kindle 7, but love this one more. It's a little smaller so it's easier to hold while using it. Great for playing on apps, checking stuff online, and reading books. Easy to travel which I love"

kplat,4,Steal for the money!,"This is a great little tablet! Me and my brother in law bought one originally for his dad because his laptop was getting a little old and the main thing he does on it is watch Youtube videos. It performs fine for what he does it for. It was such a steal my brother in law got one himself because he wanted to play games on it and again, works perfectly! Great buy for the price"
science143,5,"Great Item, Especially for Amazon Prime Members","This is a great starter tablet or tablet or kids. I bought one for myself and gave two as gifts. My daughter loves hers and uses it for homework, games, videos, and video chatting with my sister. I use mine to play games and web browse, as well as watch videos when I am waiting somewhere. I love the Amazon Music feature and use it to listen to music both in my car with the Bluetooth feature and my Bluetooth speaker system. I have Amazon Prime, so my experience has allowed me to get the most out of my tablet, but I cannot imagine using it without Prime. My only gripe is that devices on the same Prime account overlap content, which is a bit inconvenient when I am trying to keep my content separate from my daughter's. It is still a great buy and I am satisfied with my purchase."
Karin,4,Great buy!,Great tablet for the money. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or Hulu movies and read books on Hoopla. The picture is great and suits my needs. The sound is not the best but its okay.
mcl15601,5,One of the BEST Tablets I've found,"Works great, easy to use and can easily be changed to Android."
kathy,4,great tablet,"Works great, nice picture, pretty fast; only downfall is that you can't access the Google Play Store, which I needed due to some specific apps. That's the only reason for 4, not 5 stars. I will still keep it though. Great for the price"
Ruru,4,Good gift,I got this for my mother who isn't very tech savvy as I needed to get her something to get use to touch screens and smart devices. Its fairly user friendly and she is doing well with it.
jawz,4,Excellent Tablet,"For the cost, this is a best buy, if you are tech savvy there are multiple things to come from these tablets. Android is available just have to know how to get it."

Digitalog,5,Its a great little tablet for kids,We bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them. Nice prenatal features to limit use and restrict content in the Amazon eco system. Build quality seems good. Glad we choose these over the cheaper brand that was only a few bucks less.
AngelR,4,Great Tablet,Works great without having to startup your laptop to look up items on Amazon.
sleb,4,A nice tablet,"The fire is a decent tablet. It mostly uses the Amazon store so you are limited as to some of the apps. If you want something not HD to watch YouTube or search the net, then it is worth the purchase. For the price it is a well made product."
jim3,4,Great tablet for a child,I purchased this tablet for my daughter and ordered a protective case for it. She really enjoys amazon free time and I really like the way amazon software works.

timditty,4,Good,"System loads slow, but otherwise is ok. Be aware that you are not buying a full tablet. It was what I was looking for!"
DawnZ,5,Great,Great little device for traveling. Perfect for reading books & playing games on the go. Was priced great during the holidays
Dustbuster,5,Nice tablet,The amazon fire hd is really nice. Does everything I need it to
Kitty,3,meh,A bit confusing compared to the older style. I am not a big fan of this version. I wish we could take off things that we are not using like we could with the older version. Great for the price.It has an awesome parental control though.
AyoDee,5,Best tablet for the price!!,"Amazon killed the tablet market by introducing this!! $50 for a high quality tablet. Needless to say, everyone got one for Christmas. Easy to use and great quality just a wierd packaging"

Linda,4,great job !!,I like my stuff... was greatly delivered .. nice job....
Trum,5,Good deal,Works great. Love the kid option. Easy to use. Power lasts longer than I thought.
KevinDoyleJnr,4,Good gift for older adults especially reader.,very handy to buy parents or grandparents with reading the numbers of choices on ONE tablet instead of carry 10 books if you are out of state trip like plane.
BBY1,5,Great purchase!,I bought this for my grandma and she absolutely loves it! Very easy for her to figure things out and she is not tech savvy by any means! She loves reading books and getting on her Facebook so this was perfect for her!
Bruin,4,Does the basics.,"It's much lighter than my first gen version and slightly smaller. Recognizes taps much better and has a nicer keyboard. Still has a few things I don't like - kind of slow, insists on me using the Silk browser, I don't like that I can't delete certain pre-loaded apps that I will never use. There are some apps that aren't available for it, like Chromecast. For the price, it's a good little tablet for internet, reading, simple games, checking email and WatchESPN. Battery life still an issue, rarely lasts more than 5 hours with use."
donnamoma,5,Great,The amazon fires are super to use. You can do more than read a book on them.
napbur,4,memory,It`s better with a bundle of a memory cardThe operating systen doesn`t have google play by default
Jinxy,5,Gift for my self,Was a great Black Friday find I enjoy playing on it . It's easy to use
Imminentferret,5,A lot of Cheap Tablets but this the best.,Expandable memory up to 128gb. Amazon kindle/prime benefits. Small portable options with stylish accessories from a name brand as opposed to some unknown Chinese alternative. I choose Amazon everyday of every week at this price point.
JJones,4,Great product love it,This equipment is an joy to have.i would recommend product to friends.
jgmann,4,Great Tablet for the Price,"This is a very basic tablet, but the price can't be beat. I bought mine on Black Friday. The Amazon Fire 7 only supports the Amazon App store, so you will not be able to access the typical Google Play apps normally available on other brand tablets. I normally just use this as a Kindle device."
Missliz2u,5,Great First Tablet,"Purchased two for my twin girls and they love. Simple, they can download apps and watch videos. Only thing the chargers are working not only after a week."
Allen,5,Excellent tablet.,"I have get to be disappointed by a tablet from Amazon. This Fire is amazing. For the price, the speed and quality of this can not be beaten. The features are endless and the screen is beautiful. This is so much more than an e-reader. If you are in the market for both a e-reader and a versatile tablet, you can not go wrong with this."
MsDavis,4,Think of all the free books you can download,"Its lightweight, amazingly bright color display and the best thing of all is you are granted access to thousands of books that are free from amazon/"
haley94jc,4,Great tablet,"Bought it for my son and for now is working great, hope this one last longer than the others, my son loves it, can play, can watch movies, music, etc."
NoahsMom,4,Great tablet for a kid,"We started with the Nabi the 2nd edition when my son was 4. Then came a few other RCA tablets that ran out of memory or quit charging in 6 months. But I just can't justify the cost of the ipad for my 8 year old that dropped my work ipad and I had to pay $250. The Amazon fire tablet is the perfect fit for his video game playing. Since I am a prime member he loves that he can download music, books and videos for free. Being a prime member is almost necessary to make this tablet worth anything. You can only buy amazon gift cards no google play or itunes for this. So let the grandparents know. I like that it has multiple users so I can restrict the time and what he is able to view/play."
kj48,5,Great tablet for books.,Great tablet for books. Easy setup and easy to read.
WiscoKid,4,Not bad,Does the job I expected for the price I paid. Good stuff.

Bobo,5,What a steal,Unreal black Friday deal on a great product. Wish there were more like it.
rich,5,crazy price,Crazy price for tablet. Was a great christmas gift.
Husker69,5,Great for kids,"""Santa"" got this for my 7 y.o. It works well on wi-fi, can link to our movie library via DMA app, add educational apps, and can expand memory via SD card. She can't put it down (much to our chagrin)."
Kappa,2,Cheap but faulty. Not what I was expecting.,"I got this tablet with high expectations given it's from Amazon. However it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.First off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. Too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.The deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a VPN using the regular Android settings. The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of ""Google Play Store"" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad! I really wanted to like it."
alirulzz,5,best tablet purchased,for the price this is a solid win. Nothing beats this tablet for the price you are paying. a steal of a device.
Thanory,3,Google Play sideloads easy but.....,The battery on this device cannot handle true apps outside of the Amazon ecosystem. Youtube and Twitch would drain the battery in under an hour. But if used as intended it would be great for books and email.
cpmarsh61,5,Wonderful tablet for the price,"I was really surprised with this tablet. I'm glad I made the purchase. I am able to do as much and more with it as a tablet I paid much more for. I also love the size. The mobility makes it much easier to carry around better than my laptop, Great buy."
TabletUser,2,Alright tablet for the price,"The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. If you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from Amazon, there is no Google Play to get more app selection.True, you can try to side load the Google Apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. Also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the iPad Mini or other decent Android slates. I'd recommend a Samsung tablet or an iPad before I would recommend this, unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money."
Snoopy,5,Great tablet. Great value. No problems,This tablet fits my needs and at $50 the price is right.
Bree,5,Perfect Gift,"Christmas present for my kindergartener, she LOVES it!!?"
DiSpy,4,Great Starter Tablet,"I purchased several of these tablets. It's great for kids (all kinds of parental controls), but I also purchased one for my 80yr old Mother. She loves the ability to skype, check email and read her magazines and newspapers each day. She's also discovered (on her own) several games and apps in the AppStore that she suddenly can't live without. I love that when she gets stuck on something (if she can't call me) she can contact Amazon and they log right into her tablet and walk her though the issue (for free).CONS: It's slow... not for advanced users."
rater,5,perfect gift for my son,This was a perfect gift for my son for Christmas of 2015
Jake,4,Value Tablet,"If you're getting this for a ""Value Tablet"" it is a great choice.Profile UI is lacking. My main reason for the tablet was to give my kids a tool to use ABC Mouse.They have to be logged into the parent account to even use it, so it defeats the purpose of having a kid profile."
THExWALKINGxED,5,Best Tablet Ever,"This is the best tablet ever! Great price and quality! I definitely recommend everyone to get this tablet if you travel a lot or just for use casually around the house. At 49.99 price point, you can't beat that!"
jkb1992,5,Perfect for my son,"I bought this for my 9 year olds birthday. He loves it. Not too fancy, but gets the job done for him."
MissGrizz,5,Great Black Friday Deal,I came in to Best Buy to get a game for my BF and ended up walking out with this for only $35! I always wanted one and am very happy with my purchase!
Tracee,4,Good for reading,Bought for reading while traveling. The battery last a long time.
jayy,3,Okay Cheap Tablet.,"Gets the job done as a tablet I guess, apps are limited but this isn't meant to be a full on tablet, its a reader. It does freeze ad glitch a little but for the price I guess its worth it."
Prajeesh,4,For this price it is Ok,"For $35, its worth. The user interface is bit difficult to use and touch screen response is not as expected."
Jereyheart88,1,"Glorified eReader, not a tablet","Bought this for my Mom as a gift and was really disappointed. This device DOES NOT RUN FULL ANDROID. You cannot get third party apps even though they sell it as tablet. This device is only good if you only use Amazon (shopping, books, games), otherwise you can't download anything - not even a weather app. Not worth my money to be so limited - Returned the device and got the Lenovo Tab 2 A7 and we are MUCH happier with it!"
Richard,5,Tablet,"Great for browsing, streaming and everyday web usage"
Markr662004,5,Great tablet for your money!,Best recommendation for a tablet that does everything you need it to do. Expandable memory is a great upgrade to the Fire!
Rascal,5,Best tablet I have owned!,"I purchased two of these tablets and I absolutely love them! Super ""snappy"" with response time with hardly and lag. Easy to charge as well as install any apps you may want. Streams videos very well and for the price point it's a great buy. Highly recommended!"
Bestbuyguy,5,Great value,"I always buy iPads because I am an Apple fanboy, but these tablets (I bought several) have been great for the price and for what I want them for and that is to entertain kids at my business. These are much more affordable than iPads if your just playing games on them."
RFL03,5,Price,Great product for the price. Purchased this for a Christmas exchange and was the most popular item.
Michelle,4,Great beginner Tablet,This was a Christmas Present for my niece. It was perfect. Immediately became her favorite and gave her parents devices a break. Would definitely recommend.
SunnyD,5,GOOD TABLET,Got this for my Father but added a 32GB drive so he can have more storage. Love the idea that you can do that & wish Apple would do the same.
Tabby,5,Great tablet for price,Very easy to use. price is great . Very fast . My grandkids use it by them self. Videos look very good
GreatTablet,5,Better Kindle,I have a 2014 Kindle HDX and I brought two of these. One for my daughter and one for my husband. I love the new features. I will be buying one for me in the very near future. Great inexpensive price Amazon !!! Thank you for showing that better doesn't have to be extremely pricey. I also love the fact that you added a memory slot. Added 64GB to both. Thank you. Highly recommended!
Sammy,5,Great Buy Great Price,"I bought a bunch of these as gifts. They were a huge hit. The tablet has better functioning than its older versions (which also cost 3x more). I would 100% recommend anyone that wants a tablet for recreational daily uses like searching the web, reading, watching videos, playing games, and checking mail."
AMP813,5,good tablet,great tablet and very easy to use. very easy to grab and go
Nita,4,Great for Beginners,I love that this kindle is easy to use and very good for the price. My 7yr old daughter has one and husband. Bothe beginners and they are using it easily.I do not like that it is not HD quality screen and pics.

Danny,5,I got it for a 8 year-old kid and he love it,Great table for the price. You can download games and so much more. Its great for young kids.
MsUrbina1,4,Great for everyday use,It is very easy to use. It also comes with 30 free prime which is a plus to be able to use. It is kid friendly.
Kath,5,great gift,"Bought this for my mom. She mostly plays games on it, but loves it."
aachterhof,4,Nice basic tablet,"It's a $50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. We got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the car/out to eat. You may already know that it does not come with standard Google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the Play store. There are workarounds found on YouTube that you can load Google apps through a 3rd party, and I easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the Movies/TV app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. Apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. For $35 on Black Friday I guess it is still worth it. Just really wanted her movies on it.The UI is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. The lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but I guess they have to make their money somewhere. I took all the bloatware Amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. Also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. The camera is miserable on it, not that I ever use the camera even on my $500 Samsung, but just an FYI. Haven't used it enough to really comment on functionality or reliability. In the end, it's a >$50 tablet, but a decent one at that. But you defintely get what you pay for"
yazminwd,5,Great Black Friday deal,I was very pleased with this not only is it a great tablet but a great price.
Pamela,5,great purchase,"Not only was this on sale for an amazing price, but I love the parent controls on the Amazon Kindle!"

dirk,4,GREAT,GREAT TABLET FOR THE PRICE. KIDS LOVE IT. CANT BEAT IT.
Jayrose92,3,Simple tablet,"Bought i, was OK but don't use it anymore for the price it is good though"
Amanda,4,Great tablet for a beginner,I wanted something simple and easy to learn how to use. And it was just that.
lolawater,4,very small screen,"I know this was a 7"" screen, but it seems much smaller compared to my ipad.. It works fairly well, just wish I could change some of the screens around so I didn't have to scroll so much. It would be nice if there was some sort of tutorial available. Works well for games.."
tablet,4,great tablet,i like the tablet a lot its fast and easy to use and the price was right
BillyC,4,Great tablet for the money!,I bought this tablet for my nephew for Christmas. As I had a limited budget I needed something under $50. The Amazon Fire fit the bill and more. I don't know how Amazon can make money at this price point. Fantastic value!
Steven,4,Good for the price,"It is a kindle, and should be used as one - for reading. Other functions are a plus."

tadkins,5,gift,"got this a gift for a friend, she loved it and the things she can do with it."
joefuss0912,5,No brainier purchase,"Black Friday sale $35! Can't beat a Kindle Fire for that price. Functionality resembles Apple products, but still isn't an iPad/iPhone. Great price for the product though! If you don't prefer Apple products, this is something to look at!"
MR1269,5,Excellent,"I purchased two of these tablets for my children (6,3). The ease of use is fantastic and the parental controls are exactly what I was looking for. Great product."
Patience,5,Great tablet,I bought themail kindle for my daughter to use at school. It was very convenient for her. She was able to do her assignmentshe off of it.
lisa,5,Amazon Tablet,I saw one of these before for myself and this is now great for my daughter.
Coolmom,3,Okay enough for game playing,They are ok for a kid to play games on. But I don't like it for myself. I will just save for an iPad.
Notal,4,Good tablet,I bought it for my mother for Christmas and she loved it and she has not put it down since she has gotten it
Princeaiman68,5,Amazon fire,This is an excellent product especially for the price
Tech67,5,Great tablet,Bought this item on Black Friday and was going to give it as a gift but kept it for myself. Excellent value!
At95,5,Great beginner tablet,Got this as a gift for my grandmother and loaded it with games for her. Simple to use and easy for her once my son showed her the basics.
Christinefamily,5,1wasnt enough,We bought 3 of these both our sons and our granddaughter LOVE then easy to operate so far no glitches sturdy and not so expensive I have to worry about the kids breaking them and not being able to replace
Maorosz,3,"It's no iPad, but useful","I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read."
carm,5,Great tablet for the cost,We purchased 3 of these tablets for all of our children. They are perfect for them with little worry that they will get destroyed. Still functional for everything they do on them.
JenMe47,5,Fire,"Bought 4 of these on Thanksgiving Eve. With their price that night, they were an amazing gift for my daughter's Christmas gift exchange, a donation to a less fortunate family, and kept one for me. I can only speak for the one I kept, but it's a great little, easy to hold device for reading."
AdamA,4,Great for kids,"The tablet its self seem a little slow. But for the price and it being got my kids, totally acceptable"
Eric,5,Great Tablet,This tablet is a great buy at it's price point and is the perfect entry level tablet. The Kindle app is flawless and reading on the Fire is a pleasure!
EER1,4,Good for what I need,"It's not the fastest tablet, but it's fine for what I use it for. Camera is not that great."

zKat,4,Good Starter Tablets,"Purchased two at Christmas for my niece and nephew. They love them. They're safe for kids to use and easy. The only thing I dislike is the lack of control because of the fire software versus Android, but it's all good."
lgbrit8,3,Good but slow,"The tablet is nice but the internet source takes forever to load so it is just easier to use a standard computer or phone to surf the web or get on Facebook, etc."
DavidS,4,Best Sub-$100 Tablet,"Looked around for a while for an inexpensive tablet. Most of the ones under $100 were not worth purchasing. I was a little suspect when I saw the $50 Fire but having owned an Amazon tablet before I decided to try it out. I must say I was impressed. Obviously it's a budget tablet so you are not getting a full HD screen or iPad like performance but it's also a 5th of the price. It definitely powerful and responsive enough for web surfing, Facebook, casual games and media consumption. If your a Prime member it's a great way to stream all of your Amazon Video shows & movies. The build quality is much better then other tablets under $100 and it's a multi-touch screen, not one of the plastic capacitive touch screens. Great tablet for kids, grandparents, people with light needs, or people just looking for an inexpensive way to stream Amazon Video."
GiftToSis,5,Grood,Good product. Can add apps to it. Sister loved it.

NightAngel1228,5,Great product,"Got this for a Christmas gift for a friend. She loves it! No issues with product, software or quality."
mapa,3,Great for the price; some issues,"I had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to allow apps from the Google Play store to be installed. Without that capability this tablet isn't very good. Amazon just doesn't have enough apps available. I did a fare amount of research on the internet to find the process for installing the google play store. I also notice that this isn't a ""snappy"" and ""fast"" device but I wouldn't expect it to be for $50. For the right situation this is a great buy."
Putergoddess,5,Great price - great tablet,I bought this tablet for my grand daughter. She loves it! Her parents and I love the fact that she uses it to read books. Perfect!

I purchased this one for my mother, by the way. For her, I thought she could easily access her email and play mind challenging games.

Southerntonian,3,Slow loading...,Nice tablet for kids. A little slow loading. The fire time is extremely hard for children to operate. I guess it's ok for kids and beginners. I haven't decided if we are going to keep it or return it.
shortbuskustomz,3,Sound hardware,"My uncle loves this tablet and its easy for him to use it, considering his age and lack of knowledge of technology devices."

BenJALTR,5,Great Little Tablet,There's not much to say about the Fire. It's a great tablet that offers a lot of the price. Highly recommended!
GSueY,3,A little disapointed,"My old Kindle stopped charging, after 4 years, so I got the Fire to replace it. I really only needed a reader and that is how I use it. The battery runs down MUCH faster than my old Kindle. the price was right so I guess it will work fine."
NicB,5,So easy to use,Set up was automatic. I really didn't need to know anything specific. Just follow the prompts. Really great for my kids.
jealc30566,4,Great starter tablet for less than $50,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter so she can have something to play with and more importantly, to be used for her school as it's being technologically driven. Large screen and good graphics. It's great for what she needs. Parental controls are great for restricting access to accidental purchases and setting curfews so she can no longer use it at certain times w/o my code. I give this 4 stars only because the camera isn't that great. In low-light settings, it gets very pixelated, plus there's no flash."
Murray,5,$50 tablet. Awesome!,"I use this for facebook , checking email, and streaming Pandora while in a hotel. Don't ask a lot from this because at the end of the day it's still a $50 tablet. Battery life is really good, however it's really finicky about the power cord while charging. The biggest complaint I have is it wants a credit card even for free apps such as facebook and youtube. However you can work around by getting them on your desktop and having them sent to your device. Overall extremely satisfied."
srhutson,5,Great tablet at a great price,"This is the second Amazon tablet I have purchased and they both work very well. My 8 year old does his homework on the tablet. The screen is bright and clear, build quality is good and he is delighted with the number of games available"

bambam,5,Great tablet and good size.,"I was so pleased with my Fire tablet that I purchased two more for my nieces who are 4 and 2-1/2 years old. Those little fingers love the games and other features and keep the girls busy in their car seats.

Love,3,limited,It's a basic tab. Only for reading. I didn't keep it.
keilahsmom,5,Perfect Tablet for Youngster,"We got this tablet for our grandkids for Christmas so they would leave their parents phones alone. This way they can play all the games that they want on a device that is not quite as pricey as the smartphones. They love the tablet, but we needed to block the purchases from our grandson who is only 4, as he downloaded a game on Christmas that was not free before we could stop him. Our fault."

Ramandme,4,Excellent value for 3rd Kindle product,"The Fire 7 interface is much better the Kindle Fire 7 which has had problems with email. The interface is similar to a smart phone which offers a learning opportunity for novice smart phone users. I both this Fire 7 for Rose because of similar interface and her older Kindle was presenting problems.The downside is the ads that pop-up when it awakes from sleep mode, but you can't beat the price. This unit makes a great gift and two of our friends have purchased the Fire 7."

Mamasandy,4,Great tablet for my 4yr old,I also bought my one for my 15yr. old and my 14yr. old child. My 4yr. old loves it and he can play it with no problem. I think it far most the best tablet you can get for under $50. I would recommend it.
Dcate,5,Great tablet for everyone,Can't beat the price.a great Christmas gift for adults and teens.
Rosieroo,5,Amazon Fire,I like this Fire very much. The background is bright so reading is easy. It would have been nice to have some instructions included.

jeanebop,5,"Excellent Purchase - Amazon Kindle Fire 7"" Tablet","Bought 2 for Grandkids (8 & 11 yrs old) Christmas present. Easy to use, great entertainment, games, access to all their sites. They Love it!!!"
Manoj,2,Not a good tab though at a low price,"The price may be attractive, but not worth to buy. After seeing tabs like iPad, Nexus and others, you wouldn't be willing to use it as the display is just 1024 x 600 pixels, touch is not very smooth, not so good customized apps/games (though there is a way to install all Android apps). The build quality is good though."
Jackson,5,Great little tablet. My son loves it!,I got the kindle fire for my son for Christmas and is is very happy with it. No problems. Picture is great. It was a great price!
amh06,4,Great tablet for the price,"I bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. So far, so good. She is able to navigate it easily and there are lots of free games. The battery lasts a decent amount of time. We just charge it at night when we go to bed. The only downfall is you can't watch YouTube on it. I'm not really sure why. I tried researching it and there's all these steps you can take to make it work but I'm afraid I'll mess something up so I haven't tried it. All in all, for $50 it's a great little tablet."
Momofboys,5,Easy setup,"Maybe it's because their older or have had other tablets, but this was the easiest setup ever!"
MichelleD,4,Nice item,It has good graphics quality and it is easy to use. Only complaint is when using the built in keyboard it doesn't always register they right keys.

Ballsmcgee,1,Didn't connect to wifi,I was setting up 2 of the same tablet and this one wouldn't connect to the wifi. When I brought it back for an exchange there were none in store and they didn't even have them on their website! Ended up getting a refund and purchasing the same model from Amazon
bigboy,3,the most sensible tablet,Easy to download apps and nice to watch movies and my daughter loves it
Jacob14,4,Nice tablet for a child,Purchased this for my child who's in his terrible 2s! As you can imagine he has thrown the tablet around but with the protective case the tablet has survived. Overall He's really enjoying it. It's a little slow and he can get impatient but it works a lot better than most tablets. It doesn't have the greatest camera but it's good enough for a toddler. Overall it's a very decent tablet for a child!
breshawnaj,5,Awsome,I brought this tablet for my 64 year old granddad and he loves it he says it's very easy to use and sends me pictures all the time of what ever he is cooking at watching lol
cassie,5,great phone ans tablet,love the products I bought for xmas presents they liked them alot
Momof2,5,Nice tablet,"I purchased 2 of these tablets for my kids for Christmas. They seem to like it and the quality is really good for a less expensive tablet. Amazon also offers games for free that usually cost money, so they are able to get more games as I am not one to buy games on devices. It only has 8g memory but I purchased a micro SD card for both for more storage. It's fairly easy for the kids to navigate. Overall it's a great tablet for the price."
sfisher0428,1,NOT ENOUGH APPS,Its ok tablet but you dont have access to all the same apps that are in google play store. Also to really enjoy the tablet you should be memebr of amazon prime which I am not.

Mrpatoloco,2,Great for kids,Has tons of free games for the kids not so good for the average tablet user as its not that powerful but I guess that's only my opinion
Jenbeck,5,Great product for kids to use,"I went back and forth about what kind of tablet to purchase for my child. I am very impressed with the ability for things to be simple for her to navigate as well as being able to place perimeters on how long she can use the apps, Internet, and watch videos as well as how much reading time she has to have."
Gift,4,Great for anyone new to a tablet,Great gift idea got it for my father for a Christmas gift
Doug,3,"Amazon Fire 7""",It is an ok product. But the main reason for the purchase was because it was for a first time tablet owner. It is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of sucks. But like it says it is ok for the price.
Mama,5,Awesome tablet,"This is an awesome tablet, not to mention and excellent price!!!"
jeff,4,great tablet for browsing and games,The battery life is pretty good and the best feature in my opinion is the expandable memory slot. It allows me to store all of music so I don't have to use my phone and get a call in the middle of a party

My wife loves it to read books. We ended up buying a 2nd one because the use of the first was so much. we love it and cant beat the price
Nicool,4,Good for the price,I got this for 35 dollars as part of Thanksgiving promotion. Its normal price is 50. Its a good starting level tab for basic purpose. Its not as smooth as IPAD or Galaxy note but its ok for basic browsing. I specifically got this for my 3 year old to watch Youtube and play some light games and it works perfect. I am not much used to android so I found it a bit tricky to use. It also has a slot for microSD card so that solves your memory issues.
datdude,5,good cheap tablet,i purchased this for my wife to read books on she enjoys it
Sparky,4,Good computer device for beginner.,A good computer device to use when traveling at a fair price.
naqzcrhorses,4,Good basic tablet,This is great for e-reading and basic internet use.
NicolasFlamel,1,Wish I could give 0 stars,"This thing is a disaster. Unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life, you are in for disappointment. They've blocked the Google store, so good luck downloading most of the games you like. Youtube? owned by Google, so again, can't download the app. You CAN get there with the web browser, but why should you have to? I tried to download 3 games-- NONE of which would even load. In short, I owned it less than 16 hours. Waste of my time. Save your money and buy a Samsung Galaxy Tablet."
Vanessa,3,Fell one time n broke,Ok overall but brakes easily with obly one fall to the floor
Lane,5,It is fair for the price,I bought this tablet because it was a cheap alternative to use it on roadtrips and watch movies. It also is perfect for the kids to play with it without worrying to much if they break it.
LaurenDeneen,4,Great cost & product for 9 yr old,The cost was great and the features are just enough for my 9 year old daughter. I'm glad I did not get the iPad. this was a great step up from the LeapPad

Steve0001,4,Great for people new to tablets,"I got this around the holidays and I'm happy with the quality of the image and videos. You may be just fine with not having as Amazon Prime membership and just use it for light web browsing. The screen gets easily smudged but for the price, it's a great value."
sporsie,4,Good starter tablet,"I bought this as a starter tablet for my 8 year old daughter. We first bought one just for kids, but the parental controls didn't work right. So I just set up a password on the Kindle for anytime it's in use. With moderate supervision, it worked out great. She uses it mainly for reading, watching Netflix, and playing games."
TechGeek84,5,Amazing Tablet,"This tablet is great for the everyday reader and gamer , I promise it will not dissapoint."
BGenie,5,Great Table,This a great table for my granddaughter. She loves it!
River88,5,Great Kindle,"Bought this to replace my older Kindle Fire 6, got a 64GB MicroSD card for it and no problem.

Cork96,4,Perfect Kindle at a Great Price,"I bought this kindle for my 6 year old and he loves it. It is a great buy for the price.

Buddy,5,Great gift for my grandkids.,"I purchased 2 of the Kindle 7 tablets for our grandchildren. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the tablets considering the price. The grandchildren would always head for my Kindle when they came over, now that they have their own, they never ask for mine. They use them constantly, mostly to play games but they also stream videos, and even use them to help with school work. It was a great buy."
Frank,5,Great.,Great tablet Santa brought this for my son and it has zero problems unlike the Samsung Santa brought last year which was nothing but trouble and then the mother board took a s**t! You could buy about six of the fires for how much the samsung tab was!

zitzy,4,kindle,Great tablet for the price if you don't want to spend a small fortune
Tennisgal,2,Fair product for the price,"I looked at the reviews and they varied greatly. I didn't want an electric sharpener, so my choices were very limited. This pencil sharpener is adequate and suits my needs because I don't use pencils very often, but it is very slow and sounds like it's straining."

They seem to be very durable.I like the fact that I can connect them to my Amazon account and they have a lot of detailed parental controls available. I can, for example, limit time on games and movies separately from books so they spend their screen time actually getting some reading done. I can also limit total daily screen time so there is no struggle when it's time for them to get off the tablets.I'm very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend the Amazon Fire tablet."

Shopsgirl,4,Great tablet for the price,It's perfect for reading and even watching movies. The only thing that is not so great is taking pictures with the tablet.

Zeldarei,4,A solid tablet reader,"The Amazon Fire tablet is a pretty solid tablet reader for a very low price. Reading Ebooks is very comfortable and there are some really great apps available through Amazon's App Store. The one drawback is the web browser; it's a bit sluggish. This tablet is great if you are looking for an e-reader, and the price is outstanding, but if you are looking for an actual tablet computer you should look elsewhere. Don't buy this expecting it to perform as well as an iPad; it just isn't that kind of device. Overall, though, I really like this."
mitchson,4,Great tablet for the price!,This is a wonderful tablet for the price. I do a lot with Kindle based books and the size is great for reading. That it has the ability to take a 128GB Micro SD card really makes this a steal for the price.

NyCole,5,It works very well and is good for a 6year old,I actually bought this for my son and he loves it!!
Bkaa,4,Ads galore,I like the tablet but the ads can be a little offensive from time to time. I wish you could block ads for magazines and game with immodestly dressed people especially on the lock screen. The device is very nice for what I paid for it once you get passed the lock screen.

Dwaynevj,4,"OK for the price, only if you get rid of Amazon's","I bought this tablet and used it for two days and felt like returning it. It didn't have play store, amazon' s version of Android literally kills the processor and makes it too slow. Web browsing through silk browser was a pain. It took for ever to load even simple pages like google. Apps were all useless, and the only thing you could do is listen to preloaded music( not streaming music) and read ebooks. Anyway, I changed my mind in the last minute and decided to root it. Installed slimLp and got rid of Amazon's junk, and it made a huge difference. The performance is way better and it actually works like a decent tablet now. It's a great tablet for the price only if its rooted. If you have no idea of rooting or don't like to risk it, its not worth a penny! Its a good buy if you plan on rooting it."

I was able to get 4 tablets for the price of 1 Apple iPad. The kids love and they don't mind the commercial.

Malagu,4,"Good Tablet, for the price","I got this for $35 during Black Friday. Since I've had it, I noticed that the battery life does not last very long. I have to charge it at least once a day. At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""Amazon approved"" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad. This is one of those tablets that if it gets dropped, I wouldn't get a headache over it."
KimK,5,Love it!,"Works great, has a great display, easy to use. Rivals other more expensive brands."
Jobin,4,Great Tablet,"It is basically what you want in a tablet. It has everything, just buying the ads to go away was a bummer."

FloridaGrannie,1,"Fine for kids, not for adults","I ordered two of these tablets, one for 4 yr old, and another for mom. It is not user friendly, difficult to use and full of advertisements even when not online. Comes with games that kids enjoy, but very limited on other application options. Book ordering requires monthly subscriptions. We have purchased another product for mom, and the 4 yr old quickly got bored with the limited options, and I got frustrated trying to navigate."
Infatigavel451,2,Not a great tablet platform,"Compared to an equally inexpensive RCA tablet, this one has more limitations in the apps you can get. I was disappointed in its utility and prefer the RCA tablet over this one."
MissBamaGirl,4,Does what I need it to do.,"I purchased three of these. One as an upgrade to my old Kindle and two for Xmas gifts. The battery life seems short, but otherwise I have no issues. I used it primarily for reading on the train and browsing the internet."

Rocmama,5,So far so good!,I bought 2 of these on Black Friday becasue the price was amazing! I kept one for myself and gave the other one away as a raffle prize for our Christmas party.

MyDocisahorse,5,My grandkids love them!,"I have owned a 7"" Kindle Fire HD since they came out years ago. My grandkids were constantly asking to use it, so when these 7"" kindle fire's came out I decided to get them for 5 of my grandkids. They have amazing quality for the price (I have bought the junk out there for $30 - $70 and that's what they are JUNK!) and the grandkids are thrilled. I wish I had bought it for all of the kids. I have recommended this tablet to all of my friends!"

Redflash55,4,Good for the low price.,"I bought this for my wife who is not much of a tablet person. She likes it now to check emails, news, Skype and such. It was a Black Friday special. It is easy to use and small to carry in her purse. My only complaint is that the videos are not watchable at times but that may be due to my internet connection being slow at times. Overall a Best Buy!"
tphillips,4,kids love it,Purchased it for the kids and they love it. Easy to use
Jeremy,4,Excellent value for the price,"I did get this on sale right before the holidays. I was looking for a Kindle with at a minimum back lighting. Though it doesn't solve all of the glare issues, it actually made for a great tablet at a very low cost price."

SkollVargr,5,Great Tablet,"We've tried a few different brands of tablets, between the DigiLand tablet my neice has or the Polaroid tablets we bought last year. Don't buy Polaroid. The brand used to be about quality, but their tablets are terrible. Slow, unable to process much, they needed to be restarted constantly from freezing.But Amazon's Fire tablet is amazing. My mom was so happy with it. It runs so well and is just overall AWESOME."

lma14,5,User friendly and great screen,"We are really enjoying our purchase of this tablet. I bought it for my 7-year old, my husband, and myself to use. The kid-friendly controls are appreciated.

I am going to add internal memory and then we will be set!"
qv4u,5,Happy repeat costumer,"After purchasing for myself and mother in the past, I felt it was reliable and friendly enough for my 11 year old. Easy to set up and has parental controls. She loves to use it for reading and games. It's fabulous and the price was excellent and my main deciding factor. You just can't beat $49.99. Thanks Best Buy."
NyVetteGuy,4,"For the price, can't be beat...","Our household is an Apple household (3 iPads, 4 iPhones, Mac, Apple TV etc) but for the price of these tablets I gave this a try. I had low expectations due to the price point and didn't expect much as far as screen resolution etc...Set up was easy, linked with my Amazon Prime account easily as well...screen resolution doesn't compare to iPad Retina display but that's expected....battery life is ok but not on par with iPad...I use it for Ebooks as its smaller than my iPads and for checking Facebook etc if it's nearby.It can't replace iPad BUT...I bought 4 of them so everyone in my house has this small, functional tablet....Might even permanently mount as small TV screens in bathroom etc..."

Mokeyno,3,Great for kids,"Great tablet for kids, however DO NOT charge this tablet in your car! The charger in your car will ruin your tablet! The Fire 7 tablet charger can only handle so much current and your car charger has too much current! We could not power on the tablet after trying to charge our tablets using the car charger. It happened to both of our tablets and we had the tablets less than 1 month. Best Buy was nice enough to replace one tablet and give us a refund for the other (I paid more money for a nicer tablet)."

Haroldine,3,A little disappointing,"I bought three of these as christmas gifts for my grand-sons ages 3,6,11. I didn't think about the type of playstore available for them to get games. They were disappointed as they were unable to get some of the games they were used to in the playstore unless they paid for them. One of them has to be returned as it will not hold a charge which has been frustrating for the child who is trying to play his games."

jtech,4,Good for a budget tablet,Bought this for my 8 year old daughter so that I could get my iPad back. The biggest feature that I like is the ability to control her content and screen time.

sd78,5,Awesome tab,Foe the Price... Its a steal. Awesome tablet for basic needs.
Merrgy,5,Really appreciated by my 9 year old grandson.,"My 2 grandsons, ages 9 and 11, had to share a kindle which often left the 9 year old out. Now they can play games with each other on their kindles. Things are quieter now."
Casey,5,Great for kids and teens,I have purchased two of these for my children. This is sturdy and easy to use. There are parental controls as well. My 12 y/o and my 10 y/o operate these with ease. I am thinking of purchasing one as a gift for my mother.
Emurp,2,Some issues,I bought 3 of them as gifts for my nephews. It was really disapproval to learn that they were already linked to my Amazon account. I started getting notices everything's they downloaded something. I had to literally unlink everyone one of them from my account before they made a big purchase (which they did purchase Amazon Prime-which I cancelled because I wasn't ready for a $100 purchase).
Chatcat,5,Great tablet for a tech newbie,Got this for my hisband who is totally not tech savvy---he has been able to download some games for himself plus navigate a little bit on here---a major step for him.
Bakeray,4,Good entry level tablet,"This tablet is good for basic web browsing and lite app use. Great for kids, or someone who isn't going to be a heavy tablet user. Great introductory tablet."

Samiilynn,4,Great gift,"I bought this for my father for Christmas. He has a smartphone, but the screen is getting a little too smail for him to read, so I thought I smaller tablet might be nice. I was right. He absolutely loves his Kindle!"

Volksold,5,"Excellent product, great deal","I had intended on replacing my dying 7"" tablet with a larger size, but I hesitated due to the added bulk when traveling. I'm glad I waited and grabbed this one for only $34.99. I'm very happy with the clarity of the display and the few free items I've downloaded from Amazon. Earphones are a necessity for music videos/movies of course. The only thing I don't care for is the charger plug which inserts into the tablet. Time will tell if this is a weak point."
April,5,User Friendly,I bought this item for my 85 year old grandmother. She likes to play solitaire and read. She is always telling me that she plays solitaire to keep her mind sharp. I gave it to her as a christmas present and she loves it. I have since downloaded a couple of easy games for her. We haven't made it to the books or anything else yet. She is getting used to doing one thing at a time. She absolutely loves it and always has it with her. So much that I have to tell her to charge it. I am thinking of buying one for my self also.

SuburbanMom,5,Great value for the dollar!,"Device makes an excellent personal internet access machine! Some apps don't load on the device, but those are few and far between.

DownAndOut,4,Good for reading,I use my Kindle Fire mostly for reading Kindle books and I am pleased with this inexpensive little tablet.
Sshgbrown,3,Decent Amazon Fire,"We 2 Amazon Fire's for our kids for Christmas. We chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. Since having them, they have been decent, but not great. The kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear; sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to re-download the game; and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them. They are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times."
Anonymous,5,Great for the price,"Perfect tablet for the budget-minded. Obviously not as powerful or flashy as many other models, but at this price point, you can't go wrong."

TommyDodds,3,Perfect for me,I use this mini tablet at the gym to watch streaming tv and movie shows.- easy to setup- take a bit of time to get used to various screens- touch screen is a little slow to respond- bluetooth connectivity is not automatic.

Jish,2,Terrible but managable,"It all depends on what your using a 50 dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device. It is better for light use on the safe side use for 5h a day. 8h a day battery is the average, but runs down faster and over heats when playing a 3D game. But if u are on tight budget it is useful. ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals( which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores). And other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there."

Dad loves his Amazon tablet.
Omey23,5,Best Tablet with Amazing Price,I can't say enough great things about the Fire HD. At it's low cost you can still do almost everything a $600 IPAD can do. If you want a great tablet at a low cost look no further than Amazon Kindle Fire's.

pattydeez,5,Perfect tablet for children + parental controls,"Ordered 2 of these Amazon Fire tablets for my children (ages 3 & 8) to use primarily for viewing netflix, playing games, listening to music on. Very happy with these tablets, I also ordered the 'amazon freetime kid-proof case' for the tablets and they have made it through 3 months of use and abuse thus far. Highly recommend this tablet if you are looking for one for your child. Parental controls are very easy to use and provide a large number of options as far as limiting applications, time limits for use and curfew options. My children are very rough on these tablets and with the cases on them they have not caused any damage to them at all. Easy to set-up and install apps, decent battery life, decent battery charge time, great picture quality when watching netflix or other streaming media, wifi works very good, lightweight and easy to hold for extended periods of time, intuitive controls and user interface. Would highly recommend this tablet for beginners or children."

jbird,4,Solid affordable tablet.,Its a tablet under 50$ that performs well and is reliable. A must have.
MSfromSanDiego,2,If you can live within Amazon's ecosystem,"For the money, this tablet is an amazing piece of hardware. Well constructed, good fit and finish, good battery life.BUT putting non-Amazon software on the tablet is a pain, a real pain.I purchased this for my granddaughter and wanted two things, (1) YouTube and (2) Skype. It took about 2 hours to put these two apps on the tablet. In the end, I returned the tablet and purchased an Insignia (BB house brand) tablet instead."

bbysonos,4,like it,like this to stream.. but would be nice to have kodi support without hacks
Johnthemeasurer,5,Awesome reader and good basic tablet too,"I had an old (non-backlit) Kindle and loved it. When this one went on sale I bought one for my son (an avid reader like me) and he liked it so much I bought one for my wife next time it went on sale. I was going to get one for myself but the sale ended. I forgot about it, just kept using my old Kindle. Then lo and behold it went on sale again so I ran out and finally got one for myself. Keep in mind my primary use of it is as an e-reader and for that I can't imagine a better device. I can also pop online and check my email etc but I only do that when I'm on a secure WIFI (e.g. at home or a friends; I don't use hotel etc even if there is a 'password' because shared WIFI's are insecure). So for $40 it can't be beat."
Action,3,Good tablet for $ budget,"I ended up returning this tablet. For the price, $40, the tablet performed very well. However, if you have the money, do yourself a favor and step out of the Amazon lineup. The iPads are great, in my opinion the best, but they cost $$$$. From what I've experienced, the Samsung Tab A line is a solid tablet for a $$ budget. You can often find one on sale for ~$150 and its a pretty good bang-for-the buck.If the money is your ONLY concern, then this will probably work well enough for you."

He loves the fact it has a back light and can be read in the dark, and even said he reads way faster on it than before. He no longer falls asleep while reading.

Faithfulshopper,5,Kindle Fire,I purchased a Fire in November 2015 holiday sale. I have been enjoying my Fire. A parent of mine purchased a Kindle when the device first came out. I persuaded my parent to buy an updated Kindle because of all the updates in 5 years time. Now she has to learn the newer technology.

KatNadine,4,Great for a book worm!,"My previous tablet was a Samsung, it was great but it was exactly like my phone. If you love to read, the kindle fire is the perfect device. So far I have had no problems downloading and the battery lasts longer than expected, especially of you read as much as me. Also the picture quality is better than most tablets I've owned."

My amazon prime membership keeps on giving... amazon shopping first, amazon TV next... now now fire tablet.. wow.... free movies and books download... and this tablet can handle it. at lower price point than HD. i was worried about its screen.. but, you know what? it still looks good. i guess when i look at it side by side with my other galaxy tab, i can see the difference. But, when i just watch this, it looks great. I have been watching HD TV for awhile now. So, if it is bad, i will know. this one is still pretty good."
Manny,5,"Excellent product, even better price","My wife and I actually bought two of these for our two younger children. I love that they give us control over how much screen time they get, when they're available to be turned on, and when they turn off. As well as when they can play the games after their reading time. Just awesome."

Lyndon,4,Great starter tablet,"first Android tablet I have owned and I liked enough to taste the android marketplace and OS. Runs smooth and snappy display. All the Amazon apps, plus you can download the Google Play Store and have a choice between the two. Overall, definitely worth the money and neat media player if nothing else. And can't beat it for the money spent"
Sarah,5,Perfect travel tablet,I bought the Kindle Fire after I upgraded my primary tablet to a 10 inch. The 10 inch was too big to take to a coffee shop to read or to use outside. This is perfect size. I put a 2gb as card in it to hold my books. I can down load a couple of books and take it on the road.
James,5,Great Kindle for kids and adults,"I purchased a Kindle for my 8 year old son and he loves it!. As long as the wi-fi is working properly, he is able to stream videos perfectly. There is also an option through Amazon that allows the user to download videos to play later. Downloading and playing games is very easy unlike a ""child"" tablet I purchased for him previously. The only negative I would give the Kindle is it may not always have the games/apps that ITunes and Google have but I have not heard any complaints for him! Well worth the money!"
tundrachick,5,Awesome as always!,"This is my 4th Fire tablet. They're so affordable, I buy them and end up giving them away to family members."
Pete,5,Kindle Fire is wonderful,Waited quite a while before buying this Kindle reaader. Weighed it heavily against an iPad. Talked to friends about their experiences with reeaders.

dand57416,3,Good tablet for the price,"This tablet is good for the price. Just be aware there is adware that cannot be removed unless you pay Amazon $15. There are other tablets available at a similar price without the adware if you are not interested in Amazon products or services. If you are looking for an Android tablet will be disappointed. This tablet has an Android operating system but it is not available due to the Amazon operating system overriding it. The screen resolution is average. If you are an Amazon user this is a good tablet, otherwise look elsewhere."

Brit,3,Great for toddlers,I like it. Bought it as a birthday gift for a three year old and they love it
Jane,4,Basic e-reader...,Does what it's supposed to. Fine for reading or watching video. But I was anticipating it having a swype keyboard (my earlier gen kindle has one) and it doesn't. Ended up having to buy a a Bluetooth keyboard so I can use it to type notes at work.
vt23,3,Work in progress,"It does everything I need it to do, but the battery life is short lived. I bought it with the intentions to keep my toddler entertained. The battery last about 4 hours, if it runs continuously. If it is intermittent use it lasts about 12 hours. Worth it for the price."

Rich,5,Great product!,I've had my Kindle Fire for a couple of weeks and am really enjoying it. I've been impressed with the processor speed and image quality. No problems playing videos or music. The E-reader app is great and has a lot of easy-to-use features. We paired this with Amazon Prime in order to utilize its functions more fully.
Princess,5,Love it.,I had an older version of the kindle and was starting to have issues with it so decided to look into a new one. The week I decided it was time to look at purchasing a new one it was on sale! That was an added bonus. This is a great improvement over the one I had and it cost considerably less. It's much faster and has a camera.
Ksparks,3,Okay,I did not use this product I gave it as a present.
Heather277,4,Great for a kid to use,"Great for kids use, not a lot of internal storage so a memory card is useful"
nook,5,great tablet for kids,totally satisfied with performance of tablet. I would recommend to friends and family.
SM2princes,4,Great for toddlers/children,I bought this for my 2 yr old. (For his first experience with plane rides and airport waiting) it was very helpful in keeping him quiet and occupied. It can be a bit slow depending on your wifi connection but not problem enough for me to dislike it.
brodyo,4,"Kindle is great, but....","I bought this for my 7 yr. old, for reading, games, and netflix. The only minor annoyance are the ads. Its a little difficult for young new users at first, but she will figure it out! Overall a great purchase!!"

John,5,Great investment,I no longer have to worry about my phone dying on trips. This charges my phone about 4 times. Great product. I highly recommend it.
Jay19,4,Real good for entry level tablet,"I like this a lot for an entry level tablet. I am able to watch videos and set it up to read books. There is some lag at times but nothing too bad. I had to add a memory card because the 8GB is small. Some apps can be downloaded to the memory card but it does optimize itself and will create space on the hard drive. The ads are only on the lock screen, never when using the tablet."
Imme,5,Great for the price,Can't beat this tablet for the price. Great for reading and basic games. Perfect second tablet for taking places without worrying about all the things that can happen to your more expensive tablet.
GeekDad,4,Great for little kids,Bought 2 of these for my younger girls for travel. It is great. Only downfall was low storage but that was fixed by adding additional memory card.
ferdeez,5,Nice size tablet for kids,"Bought the Amazon Fire Tablet as Christmas gifts for my grandsons, ages 8 and 12. They both liked it. It has a nice size screen for them to play their games on and you can't beat the price. Better than having them play on our expensive cell phones."
Noone,4,Solid for the price,"It's been solid so far. Can get a little glitchy every now and then, the text isn't as high a quality as it could look, and it may bother some people that not all apps from Apple and Google are available on the Amazon App Store. But for the price I think it's a good deal for those who want it more for small stuff like internet browsing, email, music, videos, etc."
Earth2mother,5,Best Investment Yet!,"Tired of by buying iPad's because there's just not enough memory? Look no further! Basically the same apps in the App Store can be found here, but even better - expandable memory storage!"
DjMiami01,5,Beginner,Great for my 7 year old son. Has all his games and favorites apps installed. Easy navigation user friendly.
Pam522,4,Great tablet for the price,I bought this tablet mainly to use as an ereader. I now find myself checking emails and surfing the web too. Downloading an app is a simple process and there are lots to choose from. I use Overdrive and borrow books from my public library. I gave it a 4 because it seems a bit slow at times.
Mike,4,Great for the price,The recording quality is very good. I would recommend this product.
Janetteganda,5,Mom's Tablet,User friendly even for a non-techie person like my mom.
Pete,5,Outstanding,Tablet does great for its price segment. Very resourcelful and fun for kids.

mcc1527,5,Bang for your buck!,Bought this for my dad and he loves it. He does not do anything too extreme just basic apps. And it handles multiple apps well and for only $50 it was a great value deal. Excellent for games and light activities.
Yoshiboi13x,5,Excellent tablet,"Purchased this for my older son to be able to Skype with me over long distance. It is a great tablet and functions well for movies, games, and Skype."
CactusJax,5,Granddaughter loved it,"I bought this to replace a dedicated kids tablet (another brand) that had wonderful software but not a replaceable battery. Barely got a year and a half out of the other brand. The price difference between this and the dedicated kids version was largely a software suite subscription so I bought this. Along with her mom we found free and age appropriate software. I loaded up a micro SD card with music and audio stories. Both grand daughters love it, as they are 5 and 3 I bought the bumper to help protect it. It's not in the same league as my Samsung tablet but for 1/8 its cost or 1/6 the cost of the dedicated kid brand it's great."
Heather,5,great item,I love it! We have them for all our children and they love them
Photomom,4,"Nice size, clear screen","This is my 2nd Amazon Fire and I prefer my previous one only because I don't care for all the advertisements that pop up while I'm trying to do things on this one. Otherwise, it has good speed, clear screen, and is easy to navigate."

beardedone,4,Great tablet for price,Bought tablet for myself (50 something) Wanted something for travel and easy to store.This was perfect for my needs.Bigger than small screen phone and smaller than computer.

Johnny,5,Small tablet but works great,"Great tablet and its price for it, it's awesome my kids love it and it keeps them entertained."
Preferred,5,Excellent Tablet for busy people,"Personalized to go with my amazon Prime account and inexpensive enough to get 1 for each member of the family. Easily read books, watch movies and powrful enough to go online for shopping and reviews."
Spiderfan999,4,Looking for something for the kids,"Wanted a tablet that was cheap in price but good in quality. This is it. Plays the games they enjoy, e books, you name it. Parents controls are great. You can limit the time they have on different fields. Has help my kids with time management. They know a few minutes here and there can add up quick, or let them play later."
donshu,5,Surprised and Satisfied,I purchased this tablet for convenience and was surprised at how easy it is to use and how well it performs. It downloaded all my information from my paper white tablet and I was able to download e-mail and other important apps.
PSAngel81,5,Great tablet for daily life,"This tablet, although small, can pack a huge punch. It holds charge really well. The graphics are very high quality and there are so many amazon apps for the whole family to use. Love it. I use it all the time. Definately a great buy if on a budget."

Nikki2,2,I had not had the item more than a week and it wa.,Didn't like the return policy on this item. I couldn't purchase insurance on it in the store.
Tammy,5,"Great Tablet, Great Price",This Kindle Fire is very easy to use and has so many apps. Love it!
theafe,2,Not the best,"I got this so my son would have something to watch movies on while on a long car trip. It does that, barely. The $50 I spent for it was worth it. If you get an SD card for it you can load and watch movies. The Wi-Fi sucks and it sometimes doesn't stream movies from Netflix. Forget about YouTube."
Roly,4,Good,I bought this to replace my kindle white and it's very good
Juan,4,Good tablet,Good tablet for kidsand for adults.Does the job ...
Happy,4,Awesome tablet for the money.,The many features make this an ideal tablet purchase.
Joannie,5,good product,Affordable price awesome quality I love my Amazon fire tablet
SaraTurner,5,Great Tablet for my daughter.,This is a perfect tablet for my 9 year old daughter we weren't looking to spend a whole lot of money since she has broke two already. The only thing I wish you could change is the home screen you can't customize it like most tablets but other than that great speed the camera is ok and the battery life is great.
default,5,great tablet,"my kids love the games and browsing the web, perfect for a gift."
Teri,5,Still learning to use it.☺,"I still haven't used the camera, once I figure it out I will use it. I love the features on it. I use it for facebook mostly & emails. I also play some of the games on facebook.☺"

A lot of the games I put on are educational.The toddler and the four year old like the puzzles and ballon poppingGames. The seven year old likes thinking games, so they are all happy.So am I."
Raymond,5,Awesome device!!,Awesome device!! I used to have an iPad mini and really expected to be disappointed by the fire. I'm not. Not at all. It is great and does everything I want it to do.
mortenhappy,5,Recipient is happy,"This was given as a gift. The recipient is thoroughly happy. It is something he has wanted for awhile, mostly because his siblings have one too."
ninjatek,5,Amazing little tablet... even more amazing price!,"Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden."
chase,1,bad tablet,You cannot download any other internet service you're subject to very limited options to do things on it wish I could not have bought it
Yellie,5,Great tablet,My 10 year old absolutely loves his fire. He can download his favorite games as well as his favorite books to read.
Keke,4,Great picture clarity,"I bought two of these tablets, one for my daughter's graduation and one for me. I like the size, the sound and picture/movie quality of it. It was a great price and the option to choose different colors were nice.. I didn't give it 5 stars for the simple fact I can't get all of my important apps that I used on my android tablet, ex. one of my credit unions, favorite news station and a few others. Other than that, not too bad for the price and other features I named previously."
aram58,5,love the tablet,I would recommend this tablet to anyone that is interested in one. It is just as good as a Samsung one and half the price.
Bestbuyer,5,I like it,The quality is awesome for the price. Amazon products are always cool.
have89,5,Great gift for kids at a great price,My kids are growing out of their ipod touch and I wanted to get them something bigger. The kindle fire tablet is such a great deal so it was a no brainer to get all three of my kids one.
AnarchyAngel,3,Pretty neat,We actually bought this for my son as a replacement tablet. He likes it but does not like the fact that not every game that is available in the google play store is available on this one. Overall it is a great tablet. Works quickly and he enjoys it.
Brianna,5,Great for toddler,Bought this item for my son and he loves it it works great for movies and games that he likes to play its the perfect size for a toddler ! Can't beat the price or how great it works
Rick,4,Pretty good,Pretty good tablet not great but still solid for the price
GTC1963,4,"Pretty good for a basic 7"" tablet.","Not bad, especially for the price. Mine had one dead pixel in a prominent place that was pretty annoying. I ended up returning it and buying a 10.1"" Lenovo tablet."
Jcrp,5,Gift,This was a gift for my girlfriend a she loves it wow
Ashley,1,Waste of production funds by Amazon,"I understand you get what you pay for but come on Amazon. You make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup. The only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust. In my opinion, if any company is going to integrate the AndroidOS at least make it user friendly and 100% open. It's basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device."
BusySpider,4,Easy for kids,Bought it for my students to use. It is not a great resolution but it's great for reading books.
ThriftyMom,5,Great value!,"After searching online for the best price, I found this on bestbuy.com. I ordered it and picked it up at our local Best Buy the same day. Great product at a great price."
Fredo,3,Great for kids,This was bought for my daughter and it works great with her but I wouldn't recommend it for anything intense.
daydreamermt,5,Funtimes with Kindle fire 7 !,This is easy to use and fun to download apps with. I spend many hours on my kindle fire 7 reading and playing games and going online.
Velvet,3,"Nice, simple, intuitive tablet for the beginner.",Great value for the price. Not as user friendly as the original Kindle Fire but still a good starter tablet for those that are less tech savvy.
splendid1,1,Has problems all the time connecting to WI_FI,Tablet was ok when it worked. Seemed to always have to reset our Wi-Fi at home for this one item. Everything else worked fine.
Malk,3,Mediocre quality at a fantastic price,"This certainly isn't the most impressive device out there, but at $40 it is a fantastic value."
Scott,5,Can't beat the price,"OK, let's face it. Kindles are not the fastest nor do they come with a quad core processor. But they are great for simple reading and light web browsing. But for 39.99 on sale it was a steal. Thanks Best Buy!"
keke,5,Graduation gift,"This was a graduation gift to my son, who is going to the 6th grade! He loves it, and so do I! He had a Samsung galaxy Tab and he loves the speed of the Kindle tablet!"
Lauryn452,1,ehhh,"I've had amazon tablets in the past and this is the far worst I've bought. It was slow, drained the battery, kicking me out of the apps all the time."
Susan41319,5,Perfect size,Great little tablet....does everything I wanted it to do. It's a breeze to get online and check email.
puchuba,3,Slow but gets the job done,"Bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids. Battery lasts longer than most tablets, the reason why I gave this such a mediocre rating is because you can't put a wallpaper for the lock screen. You always have an ad for something Amazon related, which can be annoying. But if it's just something small for the kiddos to use, good choice. I wouldn't recommend for adults."
Tricia,4,Good for beginners,Good for beginners. Small for little hands. My 9 year old son loves it. He can read books on it. The video quality is great.
Mommy09,5,Absolutely love the tablet,I love the tablet . now i have time to catch up with my reading and tv shows and also facebook and magazines
Hlmaloney,5,Great deal for the money,This by far is one of the greatest tablets out there for kids. Cost is affordable and there is a lot for them to do. Keeps my 8 year old busy in drs offices. Lightweight and easy to use.
Jetstream,5,Great tablet,"Excellent product. Can get some apps that the fire stick and Roku 3 can not. Of course this is a small screen but offers more flexibility than just streaming. Its a computer, kindle and mobile device all in one."
tunasalad,5,Great Buy,I bought one for both my kids and they love it. We are very happy with the purchase.
Doug,5,Perfect for my son,The Amazon Fire is perfect for my son. He loves to play games and the app store is easy to use!
karolmommy,5,Great table,Great item ! Bought one for my 20 yr old as a Christmas gift . Ended up going back and getting one for my 11 yr old and myself as well. I am not good with electronics & this is easy to use.
Carlarco,5,Great tablet.,My 11 year old nephew actually had a tablet before I bought the kindle for his graduation. Now he only uses the kindle.
Noinoi,4,Excellent price,Excellent price and recommendable for kids & family...
1234,4,Great Tablet,Bought the tablet for my kids and they love it. I think it's prefect for them. It's a little bulky but perfect for them.
NursePaula,3,It's no iPad,"I got this tablet for my 20 month old son. He constantly wants my phone or iPad to watch YouTube kids videos. He can work both of these apple devices all on his own. I figured he was ready for his own tablet, hoping he'd leave mine alone. No luck. The Fire is not as user-friendly as my iPhone. Even on the child setting it is not easy to use. The surface is not as responsive to touch. He gets frustrated with it and puts it down after a few minutes of trying. Now his daddy uses it and he still goes after my iPad and phone. If you want a tablet for your toddler, just get an iPad."
Roni,3,It's OK...it's no android,"I thought I would get the fire as a back up tab for my grand daughters. Well, in my opinion it's a little more confusing to navigate around than just a plain android tablet. So if, like me you are an android lurana566, this is a bit different to operate."
happyphonelady,5,Amazone-Fire-7 Tablet,This was a gift for my daughter and her first tablet. She likes it and is Learning how to use it with the help of her son.It is easy to handle and the size is easy to carry with her.

Starr,5,I love Kindle's,"I am more interested in Kindles for learning apps, and all educational books for adults & children (all ages)."
Shan,5,Great for kids,Has a timer for how long your kids can be on the tablet
Desiree,4,Great for streaming media and browsing,"This is a nice, cheap little tablet. It's simple but for the price I don't have too many complaintsSome things I've noticed though is that the battery life is very short and appears to drain battery even when not in use. I find it difficult to cut and paste text and I'm not sure how or if you can save pics to the gallery. This tablet is best for streaming media and simple browsing."
Greenbean,5,Great product,I got it for my daughter to use for entertainment and she uses it everyday
AZRobert,4,First Kindle,I have looked at getting a Kindle for over a year and have looked at the specs and also other tablets. I enjoy reading and when traveling have to pack 4-6 books when I cruise. I decided to get the Kindle Fire - great price and get it a try. I love it and will someday upgrade to a larger model. Have read 5 books all ready and have 30 more waiting to be read. Great one to start using an ereader.
Ivrobin,5,Great tablet for a beginner,the kindle fire tablet was easy to use and very simple to set up. Great tablet
Irish61014,4,Voracious reader,This feels flimsier than my 2 year old kindle fire but it does what it needs to for me--store books. I especially like the blue shade feature for night reading.
Purdygrl3114,5,Great tablet for my grandkids.,"My Grand daughter that is 7yrs old learned how to shoot videos of her younger sister very quickly with this tablet. It is easy to use and very durable, even for kids. I was very happy that I purchased 2 tablets. One for each of my grand daughters. They were very affordable too."
KingrocknLR,5,Can't beat the Price!,I was needing an additional streaming device for Spotify. This handles exactly what I need.

Gift,5,Christmas Gift,Bought this for my 6 year old nephew and he loves it!
mrtwister,4,Pretty awesome for the buck,Bought it for my nephew and he loves it;his old one was slow and the space for bigger apps was limited.Good parental controls.
Saucey64,5,I am loving my Amazon Fire 7,Will Suggest this tablet to my friends. Yes I would suggest this product to my friends. I will purchase some for Christmas Gifts.
Lessh,5,Great Value,For the functionality and price it can't be beat. Why pay more for a sub par off band tablet when you can get a trusted brand. Makes a great gift especially for little ones and you don't break the bank.
Marty,5,Bought as a gift,Bought this as a gift for a child. They love it for playing games and watching videos.
Woody,4,Daughter loves it,I think it's a good starter tablet for a child. It makes it a lot easier to monitor your child while online.
SarahLady,5,Works for what we need,Easy to navigate. There's not anything new we don't like about it.
HRTOperator,4,Nice tablet for the money,Really impressed with what this tablet is capable of doing for price. At only 49 dollars it is pretty snappy accessing the internet and playing videos are sharp and clear. Most of the apps I need to use are available and free. It seems to run similar to Android tablets which should be easy for someone familiar with how android operates. This might be for kids to use but it fits with what I need to use.
Andrew,5,Nice,Good price within batter quality love it works perfectly
Pself18,5,Love it,Love the kindle. Easy to use and lots of free books to read
Miami305,4,Great Bargain!,"Usually, a $50 tablet is some cheap knockoff/no name brand limited capability tablet. For an Amazon tablet, You can't beat the price. If you're an Amazon shopper/user, this'll be a great tablet for your kid, an elderly adult in your care &/or you. For $50 (or less if you catch it on sale), I'll take the ads"
928AZ,4,"Good Tablet, Great Price!","Bought to replace older Kindle Fire. Perfect for what I need. Use mainly for e-books, apps, web browsing, and streaming occasional movies/shows."
Videoman,5,Exellent to surf the net,I have bought many of these tablets for family members and had no complaints
Vish,4,Keeps my 6 year old son busy,I bought it for my son and he has now been using it extensively for the past 2 months. His primary use is to play games and he gets bored with every game soon. So he has to find and download a new one every few days. I occasionally use it to watch some online videos as well. We'd have loved if it were a bit faster but at the price it's not something we can complain about. Overall we are both satisfied with the purchase.
Kenn,5,All I need for everyday carry,"Perfect for me. With Prime membership purchase this becomes indispensable. Always have video, games, and instant backup for documents to cloud, cheap enough to be almost disposable, no worries!"
ALCADILLAC,5,great for email and intrnet,this great for catching up on facebook or going over email
Erinrose94,5,Great Present for Grandma,We bought this as a present for my grandma for mother's day. She was ecstatic!

niche2425,4,Great Tablet and even better price,"I have had this tablet for nearly a month now and so far I love it. Is small for portability, it does what I want it and need it to do. I use it to watch movies/series/shows etc from online apps like amazon prime. The price is unbeatable for this tablet. I am def getting my $ worth out of it. Love it would recommend. Makes for a great gift. the camera isnt all that great but I dont use it to take pics at all."
MomBarb,5,Fun to Use,The best tablet I have purchased from Best Buy. Will buy more
Sunny,4,Great buy,Bought 2 for birthday presents for boys. They were on sale and a great buy. Going to be used to read on and game playing. Work well. Just wish screens were bigger.

schwartz65,5,nice!,"We bought several of these and they work great! They are compact and lightweight. They have capability to add additional memory chips, too, to increase GB capacity."
JDALY83,3,Very slow for Internet,"I purchased Amazon Fire for my son after reading enough reviews about this product. It works ok for e-books but very slow for Internet streaming and downloading. Also, the touch function is not very sensitive which you need to hit the same button couples of time to make it work."
RKTECT,5,Great small format tablet for facebook and games.,"Work perfectly for as a small tablet for checking Facebook and playting games. The screen is so much larger than the phone for easier viewing. It's nice that it can take pictures, but the quality is not up to most phones."
Rdbne,3,Ok,It's ok. It does not have all the apps you might be looking for.
Gator,5,You can't beat this tablet for the $,"This is a great tablet. My wife, my 4 year old son, and myself all use this. It is so easy to use, my 4 year old shows me all the tricks. Amazon is even easier to use which we really enjoy. I would not recommend the Nuprocase however that I think we got from amazon."
tinagina,4,Cost less than before,I bought this for my 8 year old. Very cost effective and lots of fun for him.
TwinEmbers,4,Awesome Tablet for the price,"I would recommend this product to anyone on a budget or who wants something bigger than an Iphone for searching purposes. It does everything my Iphone does. But I wanted a tablet for reading, spotify, netflix, and just the ease of a bigger screen. $40 Bucks why not!?"
Minnie,5,Great Buy,"Bought this as a gift. It was a great buy! Lightweight, great look, easy to use, great sound! I would highly recommend this product."
inquirer,3,"SD card for Kindle 7""","Purchased and installed item onto Kindle but am still trying to figure out how storage onto new SD card works. I know it is me, but I think I will have to return to store to get someone to show me how to operate."
Atilaye2005,5,Great kindle for a beginner,My kids had a good time with the kindle and now I feel like best buy is the best store ever.
Milo,5,Cheap but fun tablet,"I have amazon prime and you really get a value out of this tablet if u have the prime. Reading books is good with it, browsing web, video play, music, casual games, good battery life. Only thing thats not so good are cameras ."
Boog213,4,"Great for online search and checking emails, etc","Besides surfing online, making airfare , hotels, and rental cars reservation's, I am using banking online and able to make payments all my bills to a differents kind of business."
apls,3,Good for kids for movies,"Good for watching movies offline but not so good at internet. I also have problems with it deciding I don't have the SD card in and have to take it out and put it back in. Very frustrating!!! The first one I had didn't know the SD card was there after shutting it off. They were great about sending me a new one but now I have to call them back and tell them what is going on now. I prefer to use my old Android tablet. It also won't let me remove the password or I have to take off the free time. I have to call them and see what I can do about that. It is for her and not really for me anyway. Why do I have to have a password for everything? Not too impressed but a really good buy. The ads, when you turn it on, don't bother me at all and was worth saving the $20."
nick,5,good,like it works for what i need for my son very easy to use and
Aekem,4,Great tablet for beginner,"Very simpl to use, compact, versatile and easy to carry"
bims,5,Brother loves it,Bought it for my brother and he just loves it also the price is very reasonable. Highly recommended if you just need a regular tablet

AshM,4,Great for leisure entertainment,This is a great device for leisure entertainment. I really enjoy the games and applications that allow me to surf the web.
Mrunlockedtech,5,Great Tablet For The Price,"This is a very good tablet considering the price. While it is locked down a bit through Amazon, it was primarily purchased for a senior citizen. I felt Much better buying this rather than other similarly priced tablets."
runner,5,works great,"works as i expected... pretty fast and pretty good display as well. i can't complain at all at this price. yes, if you take a look at it side by side with galaxy ($200), this is not as good. But, as long as you use for surfing and quick things like music and games, works great."
Joelm,5,Dependable and value tablet.,The products were great. I was able to access the books that I had been craving for.
Sarah,5,Love it!,My son loves his kindle! It was relatively inexpensive and he has dropped it multiple times and not a scratch!
Mellie,4,Good tablet,"The tablet is good for my son, he enjoys using it to play games."
Monica9803,5,Great for on the go person,"I love that I can check my text from my watch, rather than pulling my phone out at inappropriate times. It helps me stay organized. There are so many features that are helpful. I reviewed the Apple Watch and I'm glad I choose this one instead, even though I have an iPhone, this watch works for all my needs."
Jays,5,Great for beginner,Very easy to use and it is very convenient. Makes great gifts for anyone!
User,4,It works,It is a tablet that cost $50. You get what you pay for. It is not more powerful than an iPad but it is in my opinion more durable and is easier to pack when traveling. I only use mine to watch videos on the road. It does have trouble connecting to certain wifi spots but this hasn't been a problem at any airports gets.The touchscreen lags but once the video starts going there hasn't been a problem. It cost less than the price to fix a broken screen on an iPhone why pass it up.
Blackpoetry32,5,Amazon Fire,"Me and my brother brought this for our mother on Mothers Day. She can't put this thing down, shout out to Amzon for this amazing product."
Aluisi,4,Good budget travel tablet,If you want any one you don't care about losing get this. It works well with anything you want to do from Netflix to reading or browsing the web. Perfect for travel. If you lose it or it gets stollen oh well you deactivate it on amazon and your out $50. Better then losing a iPad or galaxy tab. You brake it oh well out $50. Great for kids with amazing parental controls built right in.
tjd28,5,Very happy,We are very happy with this tablet. It is much better then the RCA
SamS,5,Great tablet for kids,Great stable tablet for kids. Throw in a guard for the tablet and your kid will have the same tablet for months together
MsLee27,3,Nice gadget,It allows me to have many apps and still take a good amount of pictures without running out of storage .
tjtank,5,great product,Purchased this for my mother for mother's day. she is retired and loves to play cards on her laptop and read. She doesn't shop a lot and doesn't have internet access at her home. We bought this and my daughter uses our MiFi to download numerous books periodically for her. She has also downloaded numerous games for her to play. She loves having something smaller and so handy at her fingertips when she sits down to take a break during the day.
JackR1182,5,Kids Loved This,"We have this to our kids as their Christmas gift. Not only were the apps good, but you're able to set up separate profiles for each user as well as usage timers so they don't get stuck on it for hours."

Ivancho,5,Great tablet. Video apps are hit or miss.,"This is a great tables for browsing the net, reading or listening to music. However when moving to video apps like YouTube, crunchyroll (to name a few) the video will either not play or the app won't show on the home screen. You have to do with videos provided by Bing."
Russ,5,Great for tablet,You will get your money worth. Great to carry anywhere
Tyler,5,Amazon fire,One of the best and most price efficient tablets out there
Mike,5,Excellent for a child,I bought this for my daughter after having previously used a kindle fire hd 7. This kindle was the perfect size for her and she cannot stop reading books off of it.
Jonas,4,Really good for the price,"Pros: - A beefy machine for the price;- Great battery management in standby.- a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price. Cons:- Proprietory Amazon user interface may be irritating but this is a personal preference- The app selection is limiting. But you can install google play and get all you need from there. - Brightness and resolution may not be the greatest but completely usable - a compromise for the low price- had some wi-fi issues on several occasions (compatibility issues?). It is a little weak, also-7"" may be a bit small and aspect ratio is a bit weird (long an narrow)Overall, a reasonable tab that does the job done (not many games, though) for a minimal investment"
marigodi,4,starter tablet,i originally purchased for 3 year old and it is great especially at this price i love the free amazon apps and the clarity of the tablet i just dont like the app arrangement and slideview app type
Squeaky,5,Love it!,This was a super deal! I love my Kindle and can't believe I got a tablet so inexpensive.
Emt2359,5,Awesome,"For the price I was skeptical, but this thing can do everything!!"
FoolishFrost,3,"Decent tablet, with stupid limits due to amazon...","It's a decent tablet, but keep the following in mind:- if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps, you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases. Problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases, and you have to okay every thing they do. - if you allow them access to apps and video, then that can purchase anything without limits.On top of this, they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive. While you can hack it to add these basic features, you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so.So, it's useful, but a pain too. Your needs may vary."
techiemama,5,Great Starter Tablet,"This tablet is awesome for the price point! Read, play games, consume media, surf the Web... and all for around 50 bucks! It's easy to set up and easy to use. Nice cameras and expandable memory round out the package."

electronicmom,4,great for children,"Bought this for my 6 yr old, she does everything on it, tech savy son set up parental limits on tablet, love that, it does run kind of slow when trying to watch a movie."
MOKS,5,The best deal I got on Mothers Day,I found the color my kid loved. Great kindle only costed $39.99. Fast and responsive. Crystal clear display
mmaria452,5,Gift for my nephew,This is perfect cause my nephew is more calm.. this tablet is awesome. He loves it.
RetiredScot21,4,Great Tablet,Had the HD Fire 6 and was disappointed that it did not have an SD slot. This one has the slot and has worked flawlessly. My kids love it. I bought 3 of them.
lorali,2,Prefer using previous kindle,"This version of kindle was not very impressive to me. Navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. Also I have had an issue with charging on this device since I purchased it. When it does accept the charge it will charge to 100% rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. At times when I am using I will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well & keeps falling out. I even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not."
revellen,5,Just what I wanted.,Purchased as a reward for perfect attendance for middle school students. This was just what we (and they) wanted.
StephanieP,5,Awesome,"I got this so that I could read books on it that I didn't have an actual book version of. I like it because I am able to take it with me on trips and occupy myself that way. Also, I am able to have my daughter read books on it too. The battery life is great and I have just purchased another one for my fiancé."
nobly5,5,Best bank for your buck,This is probably the best bank for your buck. Skip a fancy dinner and get the Amazon fire you wont go wrong.
MoBestBuy,3,It's okay,This tablet is okay for moderate use. Mine tends to lag while playing games or surfing the internet..
Reviewer,3,Good for the price,Its good for the price. Amazon store is not as huge as Android play store
badger,4,gave as a gift,gave as a gift along with the cover. person seemed to like it
PeterS,5,Cheap and good,"Was attracted by the low price and bought this item spontaneously when strolling at a BestBuy store - perfect ereader / tablet, although an e-ink screen type is more pleasant for your eyes. Nevertheless for short readings it is OK."
Lpod0000,4,Great tablet for the price.,This was a gift for my daughter. She wanted it to catch up on reading some books. Being able to browse the web was an added plus.
Cachito,3,Is good for a first tablet,At first I thought is was going to be great because of all the apps it had. Late I discover that all of those great apps I felt in love with needed to be purchased and pay a membership. Even though it was good for a first time tablet.
Jude,5,Just what I was looking for!!,"Perfect for checking emails. Small, but not too small to watch my favorite shows/movies!! Would highly recommend!!"
intensity,5,good case as well as keyboard,This keyboard works as a case as well for your ipad and when attached seems just like a net book...I really like it I think I will end up buying another for the mini ipad...
Nadine,5,Lovin the fire,I love mine so much I bought my grandkids all one.
TheMama,5,Perfect tablet for beginner. I,"I had purchased a tablet for my son as s Christmas gift and he loved it, he let me use it and I loved it, especially since I have problems with my hands. This tablet proved to be the best thing for me. My experience with Best Buy is the best choice I could make on my tablet. The staff is fantastic, they helped me to get the basics down pat, you can add me to your list of return consumers."
Steve,2,Worth what I paid,This really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck. I bought this for about $35 just to kill time on a couple of long flights so I didn't wear out the battery on my phone. I definitely wouldn't recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at. I only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so I got what I wanted out of it.
Mike,5,Just what I wanted,I was looking for a small tablet for the front room to run my Sonos speakers. This works great. Just keep it right next to my chair and don't have to remember my phone or ipad
lagalaxy,4,Tablet works well as I mostly use for a quick web,...browse. Buy a good case as this might slip thru your hands and fall.
capsgg,4,Good access to email while on the road.,"Got Fire tablet as an experiment. It was low cost and very compact but still and edge over my smart phone as far as screen size. Unit has worked flawlessly and has require minimum attention, but does a good job on email and recreational browsing."

bmmyer27,5,Nice product,"The Kindle I currently have is pretty nice. I did however have to send my first one back as it stopped working after 17 days. Awesomely though, Best Buy shipped me a new one free of charge even though it was past the 15 day return policy."
Rochelle,4,Good tablet for the price,"Bought for a gift, very good for a young child easy to operate"

olayo48,4,perfect for kids,My 7 yr old loves it. Easy for him to navigate and understand.
WINOCKI,5,A great affordable device that delivers!,"I love my PCs and they are in constant use, but my new addition to the family, the Amazon Fire tablet, now provides me the convenience and portability that I'd been previously missing. Every time I pick it up and turn it on I experience something new to explore and use. A real winner!"
BS47,5,Perfect for kids,"Not too expensive and the kids have their own tablet to do stuff they want to do, just use the parental controls. The quality is pretty good too!"
DarkWolf,5,IT's great,"It's perfect size to take with you any where. It has great color and the sound can get really loud for it's size. There are a number of games, books, videos, movies and apps that you can get on it.... Some of which are free. You can surf the web and also listen to music on it. My son loves his and my mother-in-law loves hers!"

Zerbster,5,Does everything I need--,Great price. Great product. Best product for the money.
joybell5,4,Great buy,Have been reviewing this tablet on amazon for some time. Its an extra for us we keep it in the living room.
MsdeeDub16,4,This is a useful tool ---- Everyone needs one.,"My first purpose was to use the tablet for taking photos cuz the boyfriend got a new Samsung. This item was in the right price range and I was not aware BestBuy sold the KINDLE FIRE - and was not aware is does more than download books, too. It is much faster to get online WiFI - much better than a pc. I have pleasantly surprised at the many uses the Fire has. I have found myself playing games on it & normally I do not play any on the PC - so if I am watching tv, I can sit here with inexpensive entertainment. Light weight, easy to carry, quick to use for camera(all kinds of settings-who knew) - Right price. Great for sending and receiving email. I suggest getting a 'stylus' for using with keyboard- and one may adjust the 'font' size for easy reading - Enjoy!"
Carrie,4,Good for a kid,I bought this for my 5 year old to watch movies on. It does the job but it takes a while just to get Google Play. They tried to block this feature but you can go youtube on how to add it. Other than that I would never buy this for myself but good enough for a kid for movies.
Charley,4,Great product for the elder,This product really helped my father in law hear and have conversations with his daughter who's voice is a higher pitch.
Kiddie,3,Was expecting more,This tablet is ok for a kid. I was expecting more because it's a Fire brand.
Tech101,4,Great tablet for kids and for entertainment use,"Tablet is great value. I brought two for my kids and they love it. Later I brought one for myself just to have a light entertainment device on the fly. The resolution on the tablet is good but don't expect the resolution of a Samsung or Apple tablet. I like the Amazon interface because you can download certain movies or shows if your a Amazon prime member. I don't think Amazon prime movies or shows are available on non-Amazon tablets so this increases the value. Some people don't like the fact that the locked screen has advertising I think it's great. It's a clever way to bring a product to the market that is affordable, reliable, and built well."
Oldgeccko,4,Great Tablet for an older dude.,"I bought this Tablet because it had high reviews, and was at a great price for a first Tablet."
atl1990,5,Good beginner tablet......,This tablet works well for me. I use it mainly for checking my email instead of having to log in into my computer all the time. I don't have a smartphone so it is perfect for me.
Star,5,Great,I loved it it was fast and great fun for the kids that cannot put it down
Gram,3,Can't give a summary,"Purchased this & turned around & within minutes of the purchase & before even leaving the store, found out that it would not do what my granddaughter needed. Unfortunately the clerk in electronics had told us it would & found out at the register by that person after she rang it up, that it would not. Need a little more education, I think..."
Littlejohn10,5,Great tablet!!!,"This is a great tablet, especially if you're a Prime Member. Only drawback is the ads."

rissskisss,5,Video chat for great grandmother,"I just needed something with a front facing camera to allow my grandmother to skype with my son. On sale for $40, a tablet that does that and allows you to stream videos...steal. Technology is a trip."

Menharve,5,Great for beginners,"I love my kindle, it's easy to navigate through the pages and apps. More people friendly than I imagined."
Aimee,4,Summer Camp,We actually bought these for our summer camp program and the kids love them. They small enough for their hands to carry and they work like a charm. The staff was super helpful.
Nicky,2,Not that easily navigated.,"It is an ok tablet. As I am using it, I lose my page quite often and have to go back to find it again. Also, I lose internet connection or am unable to connect at all. For the money, I find it acceptable but not ideal."
Aimee,4,Summer Camp,We actually bought these for summer camp and the kids love them and they work like a charm. The staff was a lot of help.
Rizzy,4,Good entry level tablet,"I got this tablet just to try out because it's very inexpensive. I say it's great for basic browsing/shopping. As long as you're not expecting optimal performance, this definitely gets the job done."
Samo,3,Good tablet Bad wifi,"The tablet is okay, I mean it does the job. However, the wifi is really spotty. We even changed the wifi password (based on a YouTube video) to ensure that it works..but it keeps going in and out"
ladybug,5,Great Kindle Tablet!,"What a great product! I've never had a tablet before, Very user friendly. Amazed at everything there is on it and all the choices you have that you can apply to it also!"
gearSTATE,4,Great for a give away tablet,"We give these out pre-loaded with course material and they are great. With the amount of stuff that we pre-load, printing would be cost prohibitive."
asummers,5,Works great for cheap version,"My Kindle fire hd stopped working and I replaced with this. Works well, the picture isn't as clear as the hd, but for the cheap price it is fine"
Marie,5,Great tablet for reading,I bought this in order to read on it while waiting for appointments. I have a larger Samsung which I love but it's bulkier and doesn't fit in my pocketbook. This is the perfect size and battery lasts longer.
music123,4,Good for light users,"Great product, would recommend it if you need a low budget tablet."
Penny,3,Kids are having fun,"My gift to my grandchildren they are on it 24/7 would recommend this, prices have gone down since I first bought my oldest granddaughter hers"

pioneers,4,Works well and very portable,"This is a nice little unit! Very portable and easy to read, or watch movies except in bright sunlight, it is easy to change the tablet light to not bother others in low light conditions"
Pharmhawk09,3,Decent tablet for the price,For the price the tablet works well. The biggest issue I've had is the battery life length. The battery seems to not last as long as my previous iPad mini.
Az480,4,Bought as a gift,Purchased this for my mother as a gift. she uses mainly Apple products so there was an adjustment to switch over to Amazon apps. If you aren't familiar with Amazon then this may be an adjustment from Google or Apple. Good for beginners and the price. I liked that there was use for additional storage for a Mini-SD so hopefully I can store movies on there for her.
Doctor,5,Mother in law,Got this for my mother in law as a christmas gift she loves it
Jeff,4,Great,This was a gift for my mother and she loves it. Great price!
John,4,Great Tablet For The Price,"I absolutely love this tablet! I love the price compared to other tablets on the market. Plus the display looks great! At first I was a bit skeptical about how it ran, or if it was any good, but I actually read a personal review about The Amazon Fire and it seemed like the person had a great time using it. The article was very helpful to me -- if you want to check it out yourself you can read it here http://www.quikrev.com/fire-tablet-7-display-wi-fi-8-gb-includes-special-offers-black/"
excidian21,5,Great Bang for the Buck,Great for the avid reader. Plenty of storage space and fun for basic internet activities.
NMeyers,5,Starter tablets for sons,My 9 year old and 4 year old sons love this tablet for games and watching Netflix and Hulu. Great size for them. I like the parental controls and easy to monitor their activity and how much time a day they can use it. Was a great price and able to get one each.

mrsvann05,4,Great for the kids,"I got 4 of these tablets, one for each of the kids, and they LOVE them! I love that I can set time limits on it and that I could set it up that they have to read for 30 min before they can play on them. I also like that there are a ton of apps and books that are free."
Ladytrek,3,I can't get it work!!,I have tried to get it work& still can't get it to work!!
DubberOne,4,Good value for the money,Nice little tablet. Works well for watching movies and listening to music. Internet use and playing some games can create slow response times.
flight23,5,"Great Tablet, Low Price","I picked up this tablet, stacking some discounts and codes while on sale for $33 delivered."
CKidz,5,Was a gift,The parent said she loved the tablet but her son loves it more. He sleeps with it to keep his siblings from touching it. Best gift ever!!!!
Sosh,5,Love the amazon fire tablet,"These are all true and they really are up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments, love love love."
Allenavx,5,Great value and functionality!,Great clarity for a tablet of this price point. Amazon provides a great operating system making it easy to maneuver and web surf. The only thing lacking is the camera not making it good for skyping or taking pictures in poor light. However given the dollar per value you can't beat it. Attractive looks good fit and finish makes it stand out in a sea of choices!
Norma,3,Good for kids,Ok for a kid tablet the size is good you can okly use there apps
Tyler2,3,Would love to try using: can't get webroot install,I can't use until I can get the webroot installed...I tried a geek but they wanted $40 to do it...I only paid that much for the tablet. Print is so small I can barely read it...there is probably an adjustment to font size but I don't want to get online without the webroot protection.
Body,5,works great for elderly people,Great product and fits all my needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet for elderly people. They seem to have no problem using it.
helenchris,4,The camera is ok,This is ok for kids but the camera is not bright enough.
dcarrnutt,4,Great tablet for the money,This tablet is well constructed and light weight and is more than I expected. The eReader part of it is the best for reading on a screen because of its blue screen feature.
releasethehugo,5,You can't find better for the money,"I use his as a second screen to watch videos I've edited in my computer. It's fast enough to play a pretty big video file with no hiccups. However, multitasking is very limited."
CastJ,5,Great tablet,I use my tablet for business and am very satisfied with it. It has excellent resolution and I have not experienced slowness. Good product.
Streamer,3,Great for Kids,"Bought this to lay on the coffee table for quick email checks and google searches. If you are looking for something to watch movies on or simple tasks, then it will do ok. Not a daily driver for sure."
MissR,5,great,I really love my kindle fire. It's my second one. It's convenient and has so many functions.
BarberKevin,5,Awesome for the price!,A great little tablet for the price. Works well. A gift for my wife to read e-books on but surfs the Internet nicely too.
Aussie,4,easy to use and just right size,"It's a great product price is right and a good size not bulky,just wish could get Google on it"
Page1,5,Nice tablet,Good tablet for reading books and magazines. I like the tablet.
ObsidioneHederam,4,Great for the price,I bought this to control devices in my home (i.e. Phillips Hue lights and Harmony logitech remote). It is a great tablet for the price and easy to use.
DoughBoy,4,Good for the kids,It is good for kids. Biggest drawback is the battery life. It doesn't seem to last as long. I wouldn't buy it for general day to day use or for anything more than playing games etc. Get the HD for those reasons.
Bookie,5,Great tablet for the price,Gave as a gift and the individual was excited. I would recommend this for anyone interested in having Wi-Fi.
12345,5,Great product,I bought this for my mom and she loves it. I would reccommend .

Labrenza0,5,Bought the tablet for my daughter she loves it,The tablet is great has a lot of great features like access to kindle books and apps.
jlivar,5,Better than expected,"I haven't paid much attention to the Fire since the very first one out years back. But recently I purchased an Amazon Echo which I am thoroughly enjoying. And I discovered that my Echo was capable of 'voice casting.' This basically means that whatever Alexa is saying can show up as text or pictures on a screen (recipe or weather map, for example) and you can then print it out! So I wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an Amazon Fire. What a deal! $50 for the most recent version that boasts all manner of things. I even get free movies! So I purchased a case for the Fire that would work as an easel stand, set it up as a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photos, and whenever I want to I can voice cast from my Amazon Echo! Playing a music album? I can see the album cover and list of songs on my Fire. Checking what's playing at which movie theater when? I can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote. And we haven't even talked about using the Fire as an easy go-to for email or games!"
Bell0001,5,Great tablet,Great great great great great great great great tablet.
Hynece,5,great pad,This little device is great. It has a quick set up and easy instructions

Bobert,3,Good for beginners,"Thos works great for surfing the web and playing games, lite and compact"
jeffthedolfan,5,Nice tablet for the money,"This is the best 7"" tablet out there for under $50 - perhaps the best tablet for under $100. It is fast and reliable"
Jess,5,Its great,I love it would recommend it .. Works great and takes really good pic
Bigboi,5,Loved it,I love this tablet. It's just the perfect gadget for my everyday life.
Vmx1970,4,Good tablet for the price,"Good for price, could have bought android tablet but it was no name for the same price. So went with it and my 5 year old really likes it. Just be careful of putting your credit card in. My son charged a bunch of games before I caught it. I thought he was just downloading free apps."
Moneyman875,5,Nice!,It's a gift for my Mother-in-Law and she's very happy with it!
MrCipher,3,Great to pass time.,The Amazon Fire is an okay product with a decent OS and a great price. Reccommend it for kids or the elderly.
cameoquilter,4,I'm happy with the tablet.,I'm learning how to use it as I am new to using a tablet..So far I'm able to do what I want to do on it. I know there is more to learn.
Headache,5,Great For the price,Very easy to use. Great for putting music on to use with wireless speaker
NatG,5,Good simple tablet,"Bought it for my mother. Relatively user friendly for someone not too familiar with smart phones and such. She seems to like it although she complains about the speed and size of the screen at times. She also likes the size though since it can easily fit in a medium to large purse. The touch screen is responsive and it has the essentials that she needs. It feels and looks nice. The App Store is ok for simple use. It's a great price for a simple, beginner, or kids tablet. I would probably purchase something more powerful for my own use."
vickybee,5,I'm in love!,"I love my new kindle! Purchased on sale for $39.99 which was a great value. Light, compact & super easy to use. A big plus for me was that with this version you can add more memory."

AmyL,5,Great product for the price,Bought this for my son for occasional use. Was able to download Google Playstore which greatly expands apps availability. No issues with playing games and watching movies. Screen quality is more than acceptable. A solid performer.

Mawmaw,5,love it,Fits nicely in my hand. My third Kindle. Granddaughter likes it too.
Fastjohnny,5,Nice inexpensive Tablet,"Perfect little tablet ., inexpensive and perfect size for what I need.."
Cactigus,4,Good starter tablet,"Bought it for my mother in a nursing home, and didn't want to take a chance of an expensive tablet getting stolen. The childproof settings are perfect for the situation to prevent random purchases. The buttons for sending email are too small for someone whose eyesight and manual dexterity aren't perfect. It's a bit slow on response time, but for the cheap price, a minor inconvenience in this situation."
Tweety,5,Good reader and tablet for my student,"Good tablet and reader. It does not have a great battery life, but it is charged quickly."
Xxvictorgxx,2,The camera is good for the price,I loved the kindle. But it took one small fall about 3 feet and half of the lcd screen broke. It's ruined I knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor???
Jetta,5,Great for Games,"I brought the particular item for my mother in law who is in her late 70s.This tablet is perfect her to play games, in large view and communicate with the grand kids."
Robert,5,Amazon Fire Tablet 7,I purchased this for my wife her old Kindle fire bite the dust. This unit has better contrast and is easier to use. She loves it.
Schiff,3,Great little tablet for the avg user BUT no iPad,"I have owned a few tablets and currently own an iPad and iPhone. I'm invested in the Amazon ecosystem via Kindle e-readers and Fire TV's. This tablet is incredibly affordable and offers acceptable performance but it's heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the Google Play store as the Amazon App Store is missing a huge number of ""every day apps"". It's a great extension for Fire TV's and it's certainly a good choice as a primary tablet for kids or parents who don't have an Apple budget. Personally I still find myself reaching for the iPad."
Charm,5,Great kindle,Bought it for my daughter she reads a lot she had the reader version for years but went blank
ferbguy9,5,Great value for indoor reader,"Purchased as a gift for tech-challenged loved one - setup and quick start very simple and straightforward. Ease of loading lots of free library books alone made it well worth the purchase. However, if you have reservations regarding outdoor glare, I'd recommend trying it out first-hand before buying."
basballmom51,5,Excellent,"I bought this for my dad. He had my sister's original Kindle Fire and it died. So for Father's Day, I bought him a new one. He loves it. He loves that it is a tablet and a Kindle in one great bundle!!"
mgore,4,Decent for it's price,"Works great, camera is not the best indoors, works well outdoors"
CandP,5,"Old model, but works fine.",Works fine with TWC RR Extreme. Better than a Smart Tv.
Hjrivera78,4,Great tablet for a beginner.,I bought this for my 71 year old mother and it's great for someone who doesn't do electronics well. I would highly recommend it for books but there is not a lot of storage so be prepared to buy an SD card.
Briteladee,5,Great tablet for the price,Great for the internet... ....Saves my phone battery
Maxine,4,Excellent,I love it. I enjoy playing games and reading on it.
Cu4rt0F3L1p3,3,Kindle Fire 8GB,"Kindle Fire is a decent tablet. The only turn off is the way Amazon has massacred the Android OS and makes it incompatible with chromecast most of the time. It's a great tablet for reading and saving media on the go. Other than the OS, Kindle Fire is a decent buy."
Rhonda,5,Great tool,Love everything about the tablet! I would recommend this to a friend
Huynh,5,Great tablet,"Great tablet for beginner, especially with wifi function and ebook purposes"
Christy,4,Great tablet for older people,My Mom wanted a tablet to read on. I bought her the fire and she loves it. It is easy to use and inexpensive
fprincessfay,3,Really Basic,This is a basic tab. I bought this for my sister. You can't really do anything much on this unless you have an amazon account and you have to buy a prime membership which is expensive. But I was still able to use it for games and internet browsing. I had difficulty using it for anything more. Camera was not the best.
JESS,5,Kindle Fire,Exactly what I orederd a great product I have ordered 3 of these from Best Buy.
Daniel,3,Good for Basic use,"Purchased Blue unit - parenthesis below is error correction for that review since BB does not allow edit. Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising/purchasing and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account, (*which is linked to and displays any saved credit card/payment data associated with your account. Not very private or secure in my opinion.*) All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need."
jecr,4,good tablet for price,good tablet for the price. only drawback is the limited apps for the fire compared to android tablets
mzles,5,Great for kids,This kindle was a great price. It is easy to work and great for kids.

Brattygrl,5,Great Start Tablet for Reader,"Easy to use,access books,love the apps,clear pict."
JazzMan,5,Such a powerful tablet for so little $$$,I you're a part of the amazon world - i.e. prime. This is incredible for the price - it just works and you can add memory to the 8gb for bringing along videos if you not on the web.
Joejod,5,Mophie product,"For someone on the go this is ideal for eliminating the hastle of always keeping your phone on a charger. Lasts several days if you have charged it!! Family member goes to school in Canada and always traveling. Ideal for this individual, works phenomenal. Will only take the charger supplied but if an additional is required you may substitute with others out there (ps4) if in a pinch it works."
ZenixMalano,5,Why buy an ipad,I have no idea why someone would need to pay hundreds for a tablet when they can just get a fire.
KatieB,5,Awesome Tablet for Amazon Prime,Great tablet. This is the third Amazon Fire I have purchased. Purchased this for my 4 year old. Got tired of sharing my tablet with her. She has tons of games and watches movies on her tablet. She also takes a lot of pictures. We decided not to get the childrens version as many reviewers stated the parental controls were annoying.
gondaa,5,Great Parental Control,I bought this for my 7 yo and I highly recommend it. You can set a timer for learning activities they have to meet before they can play games. Easy to use and the size is perfect.
jonec429,4,Good for the price,"This tablet is limited in functionality but it gets the job done, especially for the price"
Jaybeecruise,5,Good stuff,Highly recommended to all. Battery is good. A lot of things to do just like any expensive tablet on a cheaper price.
Daniel,3,Good for the money,"Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account. It even asks for your credit card, but can be removed afterward. All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need."
SciFiLover,4,Great little tablet for kids,Good tablet for the price. Doesn't have great Wi-Fi capabilities but great tablet for on the go and for kids. The 128 MB expansion slot was the selling point. Very happy with it.

Mike,5,Simply a great tablet for the price!,"This particular Kindle Fire is simply great for the price. I use it basically for reading ebooks and web news, emails, and streaming movies, as well as playing a few electronic games. It is so compact and lightweight that I can take it with me pretty much everywhere. I don't really use the camera feature since I have a much better, professional grade camera."
Jerry,4,Can't beat it for the price!,"This is a great deal, especially when on sale for $40. Great for letting my kids watch Netflix on with wifi..."
bbcustomer,4,Great price for a tablet,"The Kindle Fire was a perfect gift for my wife. She has not been a big fan of newer electronics in general and needed something compact, affordable and very easy to use."
Jedi1234,4,fire,Its a good tablet for being only 40 bucks usually people have to buy an expensive tablet for it be good.
Rkwpark,5,Great for kids,Throw it in the backseat for long car rides and you're golden
Bobfire,5,Great Gift for My Wife,I purchased this for my wife for Mother's Day as the screen on her phone was too small! She thoroughly enjoys it and uses it daily! Just what she wanted and needed!

Lynn,4,Great,Very good. My grandson uses it on a daily basis. It is fantastic
Cgatti,4,Great for price,"The kindle fire is great. I bought one for my husband when the old kindle quite working, then I bought one for my daughter to replace the iPod she lost. She loves it. I love that you can add extra storage with a mini SD card (something you cannot do on apple devices)."
THAG,5,Pretty good stuff.,"I wanted a replacement comparable to my original, and this filled the bill."
xeke,4,"Great value, decent performance","Snagged it on sale for $39.95. Then got another discount from accumulated BB points. It's not HD, but I don't find that necessary on a small screen. I like the form factor, fits into coat or jacket pocket. Amazon app store lacks the number of apps of Google store but there are easy ways to install Google apps store. While you can use it for productivity tasks with a compatible keyboard I bought it for my wife to watch youtube and netflix shows on a bigger screen than her iphone. Its wireless signal pickup distance is a bit weak, but the ability to add storage via micro SD is nice. Even at $50 it is a good buy for what it is."
Happilytaken,4,Great tablet for the price,Bought for my kids. They each have one and love them.
Bkzibda,3,Not bad for simple browsing and gaming function,Great affordable device but does not have allow for android market app downloads and is basically good for simple browsing and games.

Latin,4,Good tablet for the money,Decent and simple tablet that gets the job done.Excellent!
Jerrold,3,"Basic tablet, plagued with build quality issues","The number one aspect of this tablet is the fact that Amazon will stand behind it - for a short while. I am on my 3rd, all of which have been plagued with screen issues. Dead pixels. Everywhere. If you don't have them straight out of the box, great..but, they can develop - and in the great majority of these, they will develop. It is a known issue, and Amazon will (at least for now) replace the tablet at no charge to you. As of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' That will likely change (if it hasn't already). As far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card - which I highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware (if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you). It is a decent tablet for browsing the internet, using as an e-reader (however, the screen isn't as bright as other e-readers), or mp3 player. As they say, you get what you pay for. This is a decent basic option."
Peter,5,An excellent device,"I had a first-generation one and still in good shape. I purchased this new one mainly because of its updated OS 5. It seems also lighter. The performance is quite satisfactory. The SD feature is an important upgraded feature to the previous model. The only drawback is its over-simplified wrapping, even simpler than most low-end smart phones."
bluy47,5,Good value for the money,It does a lot of things as well as a more expensive tablet so it's strong for the money spent
Michael,4,Great,Great tablet for a gift. Does everything it needs to do.
mycritic,5,It's a good tablet for beginners,"I bought this for my mother during Mother's Day and I got a $10 off.Overall I paid around $42 for the tablet. Best tablet money can buy. It includes YouTube,Pandora and all the other good apps you get on a normal cell phone. I bought other cheap tablets on the past for a much higher price and less the quality."
Redbull,5,Can't get better,This is the best entry level tablet for kids. Cheap and with the Amazon free option you can give your kids what they like on your own terms. Also consider getting a protective case with it
Sheri,4,I LIKE IT!!!,"I am amazed at this little tablet! I had, and still have, a Kindle Paper White for 3 years before I dared to try to use it, and after using it I was intrigued by the possibilities.... I joined a public library and began reading books for free. When I had trouble downloading some books because they were EPUB instead of KINDLE, I decided to look into the FIRE. This FIRE cost me $39! Amazing. I don't use a SMART PHONE and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where I drag my laptop like a hotel or at Starbucks. This little number allows me a lot of flexibility. Besides downloading books, I can go online, I can download music from my AMAZON PRIME account for free (music that I don't want to pay for to get onto my IPOD CLASSIC). I can hook up the FIRE to my BOSE speakers and the sound is great! I already watched a PBS TV show on the FIRE while waiting to get an oil-change done on my car at the dealership. I added 64 gigs of memory for about $20, thinking that I might build quite a music library on this little machine. Since the memory is removable, if the tablet gets deep-sixed, no problem transferring the music elsewhere, I think! I have almost figured out how to get the music from the FIRE onto my MAC...but maybe it can't be done ... I don't know. AMAZON doesn't let you download from the PRIME music library to a computer...they only allow the download to tablets and phones. But there must be a way around this...I think it's been fun trying to figure it all out. On the downside, I hate the fact that the screen is not an anti-glare screen to begin with, but I bought something which I think will solve that problem. Don't like the fingerprints ... I'm trying to get used to the notion of a touch-screen. I'm OLD...I don't like change...so adapting is not that easy. But I'm working on it and I would say for the money, even adding the cost of the accessories I purchased, that this was a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity. I'm having a lot of fun with it! The tablet DOES subject one to advertising when you open it...but I ignore it. I ignore all advertising everywhere so it's not hard for me to do...it's a well-ingrained habit. If I were forced to look at and read the advertising however, then I would consider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising. But for the money you have to make allowances for commerce, I guess. I'm an APPLE person so I felt this would be very hard to figure out, but it's pretty intuitive after about 4 hours of making endless mistakes! LOL. I SAID I was old...don't expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot. Thing is you CAN figure it out. I don't read instructions so maybe if someone were more willing to have things explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve. But I only learn by trial and error. Have fun! Buy the thing...it's so cheap that if you hate it it's no big loss! The screen adjustments for reading are good...font size, background color, etc. I needed to have something that was easy on the eyes...this works for me!"
dodgers,5,Great Tablet for kids,I purchased this tablet for my grandkids and it was so easy to setup and also operate. They liked it so much that I will probably purchase two more so each grandkid will have their own.
MochisMom,2,Not a real tablet,"I've been using a Kindle forever, and when it became apparent I needed an Android device (I have a Windows phone, which I love but has serious app limitations) I thought I with a Fire I could get a tablet and upgrade my Kindle at the same time. But even with Geek Squad help I could never figure out how to upload the apps I needed onto the Fire. So back it went, replaced with a Lenovo tablet that does the trick."

lilsnap,5,Love the Kindle Fire,I purchased 2 Kindle Fires one as a gift & one for me & liked them so much that I wanted to get one for my daughter & 5 yr old granddaughter - my daughter said she has not yet gotten a chance to use it but my granddaughter loves it!

I setup these tablets and I was surprised that for the price how fast it was and it has the same apps and pretty much functionality of my 10"". The screen resolution isn't as good as a higher priced tablet. But, for $49 it's great! Even if you have a tablet already this makes for a good one just to throw in the bag with you when your out and about. I use Kindle tablets primarily for media and entertainment purposes (Amazon Prime Movies, Netflix, Hulu, and the News stand)."

Small enough to fit in my bag on the go, but big enough that I am able to type easily. Would recommend."
Krishna,4,Very good,Cheap and best product from amazon. Almost 6+ tabs bought recently. This shows how i am inspired with tables
Chris,4,Good little tablet,"So, I pretty much got this as a cheap tablet for my 2 year old. He's constantly snagging people's cell phones to play games. We figured this was inexpensive enough that if he breaks out in the next two years, it's still better than if he breaks one of our phones on contact. Overall, it's a great little tablet for the money, and we can set parental controls on it so it can grow with him over the next few years. Not bad."
MrMrs87,5,Awesome for the price,"I purchased three for my children and so far it's been a little over a month and they are still fully intact and bright and working. The speakers are loud, quality of the housing is very durable and the screen isnt scratch resistant but a screen protector can handle that. Charging is quick and the port is still very durable. The volume and home button is easy to handle and the response of the screen is still very well. The colors of the screen with games and movies is awesome. Children love it and my husband and I do as well. We catch ourselves playing as well. Lol"

John,5,Really good for the price.,"Bought one for myself and my younger sister. If you don't want or NEED to spend a couple hundred on an Ipad or something like that, This is a really good deal. I enjoy using it a lot, and so does my younger sister. Doesn't have all the fancy things the more expensive ones do, but it's not bad for the price."

Heidi,5,love it!,"I love it, very user friendly! Great for the kids, lots of aps, great purchase and great price!"
Renfield,4,Great for the price!,"This was actually an impulse purchase, I was out for the weekend and forgot my Kindle so I picked up one of these. It works so much better than you'd expect from a budget tablet, the screen is very responsive to touch and has good color reproduction. Unless your looking at the screen from just a couple inches away the pixels aren't overly distracting and the text is reasonably sharp.This is a device you can carry around and not be too upset if it gets lost or damaged, and it's a good e-reader (and cheaper than the e-paper models, oddly enough.)"
ronald,4,great tablet.....,"little slow booting up, but its good starter tablet."
Mark,5,Awesome tablet for the money,I bought these for my son and I'm very happy with my purchase. They can do everything on these that they need to do and The Price is Right in case they drop them in water

shantalle,3,You Get What You Pay For,"this item was on a hefty sale, bought two for work purposes. a bit slow and annoyed by the constant Amazon notifications / integrations but it will work for the purpose of check emails and viewing photos."
Dinky,4,Very durable,"Great entertainment,easy to use,very affordable,great education."
TeMville,3,Experience = Price,"Was surprised by reviews I read stating this device had a great display. By no means is the display bad, but please, this device only cost $40. It does not compete with the iPad and Galaxy tablets. The Fire OS needs some sharpening up."
Beauty,5,Great tablet,I bought two of it. I love the way the battery last for a long time.
Tina,4,Great for a kid!,Got this for my 5 yr old grand child. She loves it

AtlasandtheAnchor,4,On Fyah!,I bought the new Kindle Fire for my wife because I have a previous version of the Fire and love it. She hasn't really used it much but I have. It is a bit slower than previous versions but looks great and is a great value!
Yahya,5,Great price,I have the old Kindle that is similar to this but was alot more. For the price this is a steal. I will buy a couple more for gifts. The only real complaint is the speaker is a little weak so invest in headphones or a plug in speaker.
Chuckles15238,5,Great for email and reading,Bought this as an adjunct to an older Kindle and so that I can also access four email accounts easily from one place while traveling. Screen is bright and makes reading easy. Item is small enough to get into my carry-on bag and I can pull it out and read emails from my personal accounts and my business accounts. I have also purchased the extra memory to download more movies.
BillRich,5,Great little tablet,Great graphics and lots of apps and memory for the price.

cottoncandy,4,I love my gadget!,I would love if it held the charge for longer. but it is great for the things that I use it for.
Kimber,5,Great tablet for the price!,"I was very surprised by the quality and speed of this tablet, since it was only $40! I would highly recommend. Good for kids too - don't spend the extra money for the kid version, just buy them this one."
Matt,4,Great Table for the Money,"I wasn't looking for a new tablet when I saw this one for $40. With its capability, I couldn't pass it up. It's perfect for eReading, my kids can play games on it, and it functions great. It won't be a replacement for my iPad 3, but it serves it purpose well."
49ERSruletheNFL,5,Nice Tablets,I bought four of these for my children to replace the RCA tablets that no longer worked. They load much faster and the battery last longer on a single charge. The are very durable and worth the money!
Viper0821,5,Nice basic tablet,Purchase this tablet for my brother who is handicapped. Mostly so you can watch videos off of YouTube. Pretty easy for him to understand how to use a tablet. Quality of the screen and speakers are pretty decent. Really good value for how much it costs.
prettymomma,1,Returned it next day,It was so slow and problematic i couldnt even get in to the store. Switched to a Samsung and we love it!
SergioRosa,2,Nobody told it doen't like Google services.,"This would be a great deal due to the good price for an better than entry level Android tablet... but... it is impossible to play music from Google play on it. Only Amazon! That's ok, since is their business, but should make that cleat to not waste time to buy and return it :(If you have a short budget and don't care about being attached to amazon only, this tablet is for you."
brianlb21,5,Excellent Tablet!,I bought one of these for me and my son. They are great tablets for the price. The resolution is great! Obviously you aren't getting the speed of a $600 or $700 tablet but I was surprised at how quick they were. I will continue to buy every new Amazon Fire tablet that comes out. You can't beat it for the price and you can upgrade every year if they make a new one. You could upgrade every year for more than 10 years for the price of one ipad.
diamond13,5,Great tablet for the price!,I love my Amazon Fire tablet. It's the perfect size to carry in my purse. I shopped around and compared prices prior to my purchase. Best Buy had the lowest price and their customer service was excellent.
Lulu,4,Amazon Fire review,I really love my Kindle Fire I take it everywhere with me.. To the bathroom LOL what I really am pleased with my product I'm planning to get another one for a friend
Tessa94,4,Great for reading,Works well also great for reading recommend 4 star

Snack,4,Good Tablet,"Good, inexpensive tablet that covers all the basics"
xelkins,5,"User friendly , use it as my tablet","I love my new kindle. My husband bought it for me to replace the first kindle that came out. This one is so light to hold. I use it for reading, surfing the web, and listening to music, I am sure it does more. I highly recommend this kindle."
itsdw,5,Great tablet!!,Great product and so affordable...easy to operate and download programs.
techbubbie,4,great value,"Bought for granddaughter, age 11. She had no trouble setting everything up, even though she'd only been familiar with Apple's phone, ipod and ipad. Her only regret was no ""Facetime"", so Skype will suffice. Video quality is great, can't beat the price!"
MxLoveland,4,I Like the flexability,"I like the Kindle fire, but is lacking on instruction. Hard to figure out how to use the features. Definitely need a stylus tool to use."
Berna,4,Helpful to watch videos from Prime when flying,"I recently purchased this item for various reasons and so far it meets my expectations. However, I did have an issue with the voice volume on the video why flying for 5 hours."
Amad,4,Great ereader,Great for reading books on. Has lots of other features as well.
Smurf215,3,Hate Amazon,Hate Amazon! The app store doesn't have cool apps!

Betty,4,Great for reading,Light weight is great. Screen is a little too small for some games.
yoli,5,Great Tablet for Reading and Games,Bought the Kindle fire for reading and for my kids gaming apps. Very user friendly with quick and easy access to amazon shopping
nukecheese,4,good value,No cheaper reader on the market. Great value. Good product.
ArmyVeteran,5,HP computer,The lady that helped me was very professional and knowledgeable. She understood what I was looking for let me know that she would have to order it. She did just that and it showed up 2 days earlier than originally told.
Gator,5,This is the best bang for your buck!,This is my son's and he loves it. It has nice picture good speed and he uses it all the time. My only regret is it didn't get 1 for myself.

Sexxychocolate83,5,Great tablet,Great tablet... Easy to operate and very durable..
TP1013,5,Great tablet at a great price!,I have other kindle and got this just so everyone has access to all of our prime membership features. And so they would leave my kindle HD alone.lol. Easy setup and straightforward intuitive to use.
toot,5,daughter loves it,"My daughter loves this tablet, its easy to used and secure enough to not have stolen."
Skip,5,Excellent Tablet for the price,We love the tablet and its functionality. You can't beat the price and get the same quality.

MarkO,4,Does good for the price,"I wasn't looking for anything complicated just something to read books on, play a few games, watch videos. At those things it does very well."
1979Gamer,4,Great tablet for $50.,"This is an excellent tablet to have if you aren't looking to spend too much. Doesn't have tons of features, however, it has the main basics: music, web browsing, email, video/movies, gaming, and reading. Plus, if your an Amazon Prime member, you can get great games for free like Real Racing 3, and DuckTales. Also, great as a young child's tablet."
NateinTomball,3,Solid for the price,"The system is a little slow and then if you get the one with the offers, they slow down your reading a bit. But, you can't beat the price. This is not a full tablet. It' an E-Reader with a lot of enhanced functions."
redfalcon518,5,Love it!,Great graphics! Great battery. Bought for my nephew and he loved it!
octubre68,4,great tablet for beginner,"I BOUGHT THIS TABLET FOR MY GRANDSON IN HIS BIRTHDAY, AND HE IS SOOO HAPPY"
FreeBird,4,Got me reading more,"A friend recommended I buy one. He paid $50 for his. When I saw it on sale at Best Buy for $39 I snagged one, I wish I understood the features better. I mostly use it for reading before bed. It's my first time doing so on a Kindle. Was surprised to like it so much! I live in a small trailer. It is great to an electronic library."
Sumar,5,Good product for the price,"Nice product for the price , very good tablet for beginners"
artsaves,4,Starter tablet,Nice tablet to teach my nephew about computers however I wish I would have realized that you can not access the play store.
Bulldog4veritas,1,Broken straight out of package,"I bought this as a birthday gift a few weeks before the party. When it was removed from package and turned on, the image was cracked like the screen was broken, but screen was not broken. Best Buy washed their hands of it and said to call Amazon. I did and had to go through over a week's worth of calling them to get it replaced. Best Buy lost me as a customer over this. If you buy this from them, make them open it before you pay to verify it works."
Gabriel,5,Great Tablet for a child,My child is very satisfy with his tablet. He really enjoy watching videos and play games. Is worth it.

sr2500,4,Great value for the price,"Good tablet for the price. Has all features needed. Typing was difficult, but using a stylus fixed those issues. Has enough technology built into it that it won't be obsolete in a few months like some of the off brand stuff."

Angie,5,Great tablet,I love this kindle tablet. Its speed is awesome. And its a great device for young children.

Steve,4,Nice Tablet,"I was in a Best Buy store when I saw the tablet on display with a sale tag indicating a price of $39.99. I bought it simply based on price. I have a desktop computer, two laptops, two iPads. In other words, I am computer poor. I use this tablet on airplanes to read books, access email, play games, confirm reservations. It is fast, highly portable and easy to use. The battery does last too long but that is not a problem. It is, after all, a $40 tablet. I bought several to give as gifts to nieces and nephews. It is a good computer for kids to use when learning."
Hemme11,4,my kids love it,My kids love it ... could be a little more user friendly for kids.
Techuser,5,Great tablet,"Bought this tablet for my wife. Basic email, Facebook and web surfing. Does everything you need to and for the price no other tablet came close. Second fire tablet we bought. I am using mine to write this"
mamaof4boys,5,love it,"We purchased 3 tablets before settling with this one. The parental controls are great, easy enough for my 4 year old to play on. Just bought another one for my 7 year old."
Sunny,5,Great camera,I bought this Tablet for my 3 years old granddaughter and she really loves it. Very easy to use !
Kevin,4,Great tablet for price.,Only negative is pop-up ads. Don't quite understand the need for ads.
Typs2000,5,Great Tablet,"I purchased the 6 inch Fire HD and liked it; however his tablet is a better value. It not only lets you access all of the Amazon features, but it allows you to expand the memory for greater storage. Great value for the price."
Pooh,5,Great item,Great item to used. Can get alot of apps and games.
Max1225,5,Great Tablet,This tablet works great for the price. This is my backup tablet for traveling since at the price is easy to replace
MrGwatt,4,Good for my 11 yr old Grandson,Bought for 11 yr old Grandson. The look on his face made the money more than worth it. Kindle makes good products & I've been a long time Best Buy customer. never had a complaint.
odysseus07,5,"cheap, simple, works",my wife bought this for herself and loves it. has had it for two months
KingEdward,3,The color quality is good for a small tablet,"The first one I bought had a battery failure. It wouldn't charge. Best Buy graciously supported me with a replacement. I like the tablet. Two enhancements that would be nice on it are 1) Speech to text capability and 2) Google Playstore preloaded.If you're using it for reading and internet browsing it is very good.Also, Alex (She) gave me great customer support. Kudos Alex!"
Kaitie,5,Great tablet,I really like my Kindle Fire. Just make sure that when you get a free month of Amazon Prime that you cancel it before it expires otherwise you will be charged over $100.
KnowledgeTech,3,Advertising monster,"After purchasing 4 Amazon Fire tablets i immediately noticed the amount of advertisement they came with at the pricing of the tablet that I bought. There's always some kind of advertisement on the screen when it wakes up. My other issue is after adding a card to make a few purchases for some apps for my kids. I removed the ability to make purchases without a password, well that did not actually happen. For a few days my children were able to make purchases in apps without any props that said; are you sure or asking for a password. I've had to completely remove the accounts and reinstall a different account for them to be able to stop making purchases. I also had them transfer the purchases to the new email a big hassle. Overall the tablet works good great for the kids."
BIGBOY1,5,BEGINNERS TABLET GREAT FOR THE KIDS,"NEED A CHEAP ALTERNATIVE TO A TABLET, THIS IS IT !"
MsPrescott,5,Happy,This was the best thing to happen for me and my family with the way you can set up the kid mode is awesome and the overall functionality of it is very easy
Coopy,3,Nice Tablet - No Google Play,"Nice built tablet. You need to note that it has Amazon Store, and no Google Play Store."
Moemoe,4,It's ok.,It's not bad especially considering the price.i would recommend
PapaGTX,5,Great Little Android-Like Device,I had no Idea that this device would be so much fun to use. It's not an iPad mini but in many respects works just as well. It is the best $50 I've ever spent. I was able to root this tablet and install a custom rom which makes this even better. Its nice to know that you do not have to spend a fortune for a big name brand device to get the same quality Android experience.
Nixs,4,Good price for the tablet.,Very good price for this tablet. It is a gift for my son.
Huckm,5,I love this tablet!,This tablet is way more than expected! I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter to play minecraft on and she hasnt complained yet!
Bugermiester,5,Great for price,Only $40 you can't beat it. Touch screen is a little janky but nothing a stylus cannot cure can also add media via microdisk and outfit with kodi and its a wrap
ChrissyZesk,5,I love it ! It holds a charge for at least 4- 5,My laptop broke so I needed something so for the price I couldn't go wrong.
XinnoVinc,4,Exceeds the Price With Quality,"This tablet is fast, expendable and cheap! It runs the Android OS, which houses most of the games and apps you'll find on any Android phone. My only complaints with this tablet are the screen and cameras. The screen becomes washed out at a 45 degree angle or more and the cameras are unusable due to the noise they produce. Otherwise, this is a really great product!"
Grandma,5,Happy grandchildren,"Over all, my grandchildren are happy with their tablets."
Tymeka,5,Great tablet for anyone.,This is amazing for the price. I purchased this for a teenager and he loves it.
bmanno,4,great price,does everything and more...very easy to operate and set up...
Shelszoo,5,Great for an ebook lover!,I started the set up process and it automatically pulled over the ebooks I had on my iPad app. Then I started adding more books. Just wish I would have bought more memory!
Vincent,4,Good tablet,Bargain for the price. Long battery life. The screen quality is good. I use this tablet everyday.
king,5,Great first reader,"I like the size and quality of the picture screen. user friendly, and apps are good. nice to have a library at your fingertips."
Davidbtjr,5,My kids love it,I got it for my kids and they love it they play with it every day
GalaxyClassics,4,Great for basic media,"Great tablet for the money and basic media. I enjoy it for reading, audible, and streaming video. Uses Amazon App Store which uses google play. Thousands of apps!"
CalifornianPrince,5,Works!,I bought it for my 4 year old nephew. He is able to use it with ease. Its a great product for the pirce
Fede,4,OS slow,Its a good product but the OS is kind of slow.Also when connected to the internet it will sometimes disconnect itself.
RCroney,5,great starter tablet,Great product for a great price. Would highly recommend
cosycutiepie,5,Good tablet,"Good tablet for my grand kid had to replace defective one, but otherwise great gorgeous his use"
Elena,1,To slow,Bought for my grandson he doesn't like it it's to slow..
lala40,4,Easy to use features,Nice for all the basics Would have been nice to be able to download a mp3 music downloader
Nadine,5,Tablet,Bought this for my daughters elderly friend across the street. She loves it.
RYan,3,"Certainly not an iPad, but good price","iPad without the bells and whistles. The parental controls are good, but a bit confusing. Haven't had the time to sit down and sort it out"
Monkey,5,Great,Brought for my four year old he loves it has no problems using it at all
RayRay,3,Good tablet,I was excited to get this because of the price. After taking it home I started noticing things that bothered me. I use samsung devices and the amazon app store does not have a lot of the same apps. Even chrome would not work on this device. I did return this because I was looking for more than a bare stock tablet. But if that's what your looking for its great!
kaos21090,5,Great item,Very portable. Easy to use. Well worth the price..
Billy,3,Ok,"This is a ok tablet, worth $50 is a little slow, but for the money it's ok"
Anand,3,Display should have been better,Even though the price of the tablet matters the display and resolution should have been much better. Feels like working in the tablet without the charger connected. Amazon disappointed me with this product. Minor issues in installing the apps which are available in iOS too.
SatisfiedCustomer,5,Nice product and inexpensive!,Great product purchased for my elderly parents. Very user friendly and inexpensive!
Rrbcbourne,5,Great Kindle Fire,"My son's already each had one. Got one for my husband. Great value, and all are reading more than they ever did."
MrChad,4,Great Reader,"I purchased this device as a dedicated reader with the occasional web browsing and video streaming and I am very happy with it for that purpose. It is the right size and the right weight. The Amazon case (sold separately) gives it a real book feel. If you are looking for more multi-purpose use, you may find this device frustrating - especially if you have invested in Google's ecosystem. The device runs on Fire OS - Amazon's flavor of Android - and app purchases are made through Amazon's app store. Google Play store and Google Services are not available on this device, and the most essential Google apps (e.g. YouTube) are not available in Amazon's app store. That said, it's still an excellent device for this price point."
Mauro,5,I bought 4 of them,My nieces and nephews love it. Even my 40 yrs old cousin got one and he is thrilled about it. Really easy to use.
Josie,5,right size to handle,"comfortable to hold while reading, not easy to rotate."
Alvucard76,5,Great tablet for kids!,great tablet and great price that I purchase 3 for all my children. They have no complaints. And if it breaks I can easily afford buying a new one.
Sergiojrismyname,5,Great for the price,Does the job for a 50 dollar tablet. I used it to watch movies and music. Worked great for that. Get it!
Slimshady81,3,Tablet for basic use,"This tablet is good to browse the web, check emails, watch youtube videos,... The screen is small but still bigger than any smartphone.It's a bit slow but it's a good bang for the buck.Big drawback: no access to google play and no support for chromecast if you want to cast to your TV."
Lopez,5,Cant go wrong,"Bought it on sale for $10 less than buying it from Amazon, My only complaint would be that I should have grabbed 2 instead of just one!"
brewerchic79,4,amazon tablet,A great buy for the money. Very easy to set up and use. I recommend to anyone looking for a small tablet.
StoreIt101,5,Very impressive,"Build quality-- very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling."
JadeLow,5,just what i wanted,I was looking for something basic to read on before bed and this fit the bill perfectly. Bonus it has camera lol
Snoop,4,Not bad,"You really can't go too wrong with this purchase because of the price. Works very well, but don't expect iPad quality. Does everything I've asked of it, but some web pages are harder to read partially because of it's small size (which can be handy) and it's lower resolution. It's a good second tablet and is better watching a movie on, then a smaller phone. Can throw it in a small travel bag and not feel you have to be quite so careful with it as you might be with a more expensive tablet."
Edward45,4,Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black,"Great product perfect for my needs at home. Used for my TV remote to Roku, radio apps wireless connection to my sound bar and fast browser all in one. I only paid $35 for this device brand new from best buy."
Larry,5,Good product,"Very helpful for keeping fitness, health and weight goals"
StevieS,5,Fantastic for the Price,"There are definitely better tablets out there but being able to read books, surf the internet and play games for $50 is a no brainer."
LittleTwila,5,Simple Tablet for a beginner,This is a simple tablet - light and very portable for a child. There are many free apps available and they work fine on this tablet.
KBHORNSFAN,4,Great e-reader,"I really enjoy my e-reader. It is light, and easy to use."
Vic523,4,"ok, would be better with some directions",would be nice with some simple start up directions and links to website hints.
tmonet,5,Gift for my Grandfather (he loves it),"Can't say anything bad about it. Great price and a great deal. Does everything that my grandfather needs such as reading, internet and fun games to pass time."
Benny,4,Good price,Good price. Battery life is good for a color tablet but you have to learn to charge more often after being used to a white pages tablet that does not use the same power.
Brody,3,"It is OK, But I prefer the kindle Fire HDX.","II like that you can undo Emails, if you accidentally deleted them."
Cheese,4,Great,I bought this for my niece and she loves it. She can read all the books she wants and it is a perfect size.
TheJammer,4,"Great for facebook, Kindle/Amazon apps...","If your looking for a tablet to surf internet, facebook, emails, etc. than this is it. I can watch crystal clear movies through app Netflix/Infinity- live TV and shows. No tablet out there to beat this $39.99 product. So far so good!"
TBBT76,2,Started out great,"everything started out great, but then about 9 days into owning the fire, could not locate wifi, doesn't work without wifi"
Clone,4,It's a nice 8gb tablet and space can be expanded.,Bought it for hubby and he loves it. The micro SD slot for more download space is great for movies and games. It also allows him to remote him in to his computer when he is away from home with an app.
Aleigh28,4,Great deal,"I initially wanted to buy a kindle but couldn't pass up the great deal and thought I could exchange it if I changed my mind. It works great and has plenty of memory for what I needed, which was strictly to read. I liked that I could also watch Netflix on it. The only downside for me is that unlike the kindle I can't read it in the sun, but that's not that much of an inconvenience so far. Overall I've been very happy with it."
GoldenBoy84,5,Wonderful tablet!,Great basic tablet !Lightweight and durable .Great buy!
StacyJ,5,Excellent value for the money,By far the best small tablet for the money that I could ever find. I bought one for my niece three years ago and she absolutely loves it a great buy.
Jaaakkkeee,5,Great Tablet,"this is a great tablet for the price, works a lot like an ipad I would recommend it"
TGODKING,3,Good tablet,This tablet has a great price but don't let that fool you. The tablet performs much lower that other tablets I've used.
FloridaSandman,4,Kindle Fire - 5th Gen,"(vs. Kindle Fire HD v.8.5) For the price, pretty darn cool. Lot faster than my old Fire HD. Don't like the display screen - to much app clutter. WiFi not the best for speed connection (tested over 4 connections). All-In-All . . for reading, kids, an easy device, and fast . . Yea, it is Good buy. Just don't expect miracle speed, a lot of bells-and-whistles, or anything fancy. I like it. IMHO."

It is a version of Android, and will take many but not all android apps. Actually, I haven't used many conventional android apps with it, and none of them has failed to work.

MsJuicy,5,Sale,Got the tablet while it was on sale. Great choice.
Benh,4,"Good, though I ended up returning it","I ended up returning it, but it's nothing really wrong with the device itself. Despite the low specs, it was mostly responsive and pretty snappy, though I've owned better. I'm just not super invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so I was missing things that other tablets have access to, like Nook/Kobo stores, Microsoft Office, and the like. Good choice for a kid's tablet just because it's small and you won't cry much if you lose or break it."
Cancom,4,Great tablet for the price,"Wish tablet was voice capable. Only problem was how long it took for the Merrillville, IN store to restock. They ran out at Christmas. It took about 2 months before they were available again."
BigBilly,5,The very best tablet you can buy for the money,"I have five iPads and they work well but they cost hundreds more then the Fire. The Fire is fast ,very good battery life, the screen is great and is very easy to learn. It is not a iPad but I use it more than I use my iPad. Small ,easy to hold and read. I can't say anything bad about it. Works very well and I like it very much. Also I bought three more of them for my grandkids to play with and they like there's also, PS they also have iPads but use the fire more."

I was afraid that the 7"" size would not be large enough but it is working out perfectly for me! It's size makes it extremely easy to carry and the graphics are amazing. I am sooo happy that I decided to get this tablet. It truly is a (forgive the pun) ""Best Buy"""

handyman,5,Great back up,This tablet is a great back up tablet for the money............
CNYRP,4,For the $....not too bad,"It isn't blazing fast....but fine for streaming music to a Bluetooth device. Hey....for $39 at BB I'm not complaining. Amazon appstore somewhat limited, but you can download android .apk apps (like Firefox, Opera Browser,etc) that work fine. Silk browser can be speeded up a bit with settings adjustments. Buy a class 10 micro-sd card (they're soo cheap now) because you only get 8GB onboard and will get used up real fast. Wireless not dual band so forget 5G, but does have decent range. People say screen resolution not fantastic, but I've watched many a network show with TW Cable app and HD is pretty decent."
Shoe3r,5,Great for the price,Great tablet for the price. If you have Amazon prime it's even better
Andy,5,Great!,Amazing deal for solidly built tablet. If you're looking for some thing basic this is the one

Luna,4,It's a great tablet for the price,"It's a wonderful tablet and e-reader for what you pay. My only complaint is it's a little laggy and the screen is sometimes unresponsive. I also don't like that I can't put my ebooks on my memory card. It's frustrating. Other than that, it's wonderful."
Mike,5,Nice tablet,Using it for my 5 years daughter. She is handling very easily without much supervision
GPtown,5,Cheap Android(ish) tablet,"I wanted a cheap e-reader that I could use also as an Android tablet if I wanted to. This fitted the bill, especially as a daily deal. It does what I wanted it to and at a very good price."
Geekytech,5,Awesome when you don't get a defective one.,"These are great little tablets when you get a working one. I had to call Amazon to return 3 times because they kept sending new faulty ones. Dead pixels on 3 out of 5 fires and also the screen had yellow tint and looked blown up or zoomed in making the text blurry. I had to keep 2 of the yellow tinted ones because that was better than dead pixels. I just ordered 2 more fires and hoping I don't get the same problems.Other than that they work super fast and the feel is sturdy and of high quality and makes it feel better in your hand than an iPad mini. We love this fire! *I have a transformer, iPad mini retina, Sony Reader, kindle hd 8.9, a note 4, a Sony z3, iPhone 6s, Galaxy s3 and s4 and LG G4 to compare with.Overall, this tablet is the perfect size and will not disappoint. And the new OS is much nicer than the older kindles."
JJLOC,4,Adequate,I needed to replace my old Kindle reader. This gave me an inexpensive reader and a tablet. Screen quality is not as sharp as HD and contrast is not as good as I'd like. BUT it is a great deal and meets the need.
OldGamer,5,Great Tablet,For under $40 it is a great buy for a tablet. I don't like that the charger port is next to the buttons on the side.
Anonymous,4,Great for price,Saw this on sale for $40 so i bought it.For that price it is a great tablet

SirNymn,5,Great Tablet,I am big fan of Kindle fires. This particular one is very good as a basic tablet for e-books movies email and anything basic Internet wise . The resolution is low however movie still look good they sound good and all in all I'm quite pleased . The only issue someone may have is that it is not an android Amazon may not have the vast amount of apps that android do but this is something that can be overcome . So bottom line goody reader good movie and television application or apparatus and all in all good for the entire family

Gadgetpett,3,Slow and no Google App Store but dirt cheap,"I needed an Android device to run an app no longer on the iOS App Store. I later learned it wasn't in Amazon's store so I had to install a work around. Got the Play store, downloaded the app and deleted the Play store. It wouldn't be my first choice in tablets but it doesnwhat I purchased it for and does it better than I expected. I don't appreciate the lack of security and encryption but I intentionally leave private info off the device so it doesn't impact me."

Gill,5,best bang for your buck!!,"As a full time student, I wanted a budget tablet that would let me read pdf files, open class notes and powerpoint presentations. I got the fire 7 when it was on sale for 39.99. It does what I wanted and more. I use it for class and to kill time between classes with games, movies, and youtube. Battery will last two days of constant use, the size is perfect and fits my pant pocket (back). Overall great buy. Only downfall is the volume to my headphones, I found it to be quite low, but for the price, good enough."

Panndor,5,"Best tablet for the money, Great for Kids","I would have to say that I've been impressed with this entry level tablet from Amazon, I personally really enjoy my Kindle HDX (which is a much higher class of tablet then this one), but for the Kids this tablet has been perfect. Good battery life, enough performance and storage for reading and entertainment and at less than $50 it has the quality that you can't find in the knock off brands at the same price point ... and when caught on sale you can sometimes even get this little e-reader for less than $40. Well worth every penny."
GigaiFriends,5,Best Budget Tablet!!,"I've had a previous Kindle before, and it needed to be replaced. I'm glad I put it off...until this gem happened to come out. I still can't believe that for the price of a random, often low quality tablet (done that too) you get...a KINDLE. Yes, it's a smaller screen and not quite HD like I've been spoiled with, but the resolution is still fantastic, the speed is amazing, and customer service if it needs to be looked at has a turn around of 2-3 days... (I had a minor issue with preparing of microSD apps being slow, but I just decided to deal with it.)"

I have hooked it up to public wifi and seems to work OK, did not do much as don't know if any security there."
Icouldabeenageek,3,Kid is happy again,replacement for broken screen tablet on grandson's tablet...he's happy
aw71986,4,Good cheap tablet,I got this for a cheap tablet and I love having it
rosanne7648,5,First Tablet,This is my first tablet. I has been fun learning how to use it. Great price.
Mutie,3,Great for travel,I bought this for the offline movie download capability. When I travel it is amazing
Tammy,4,Value for Money.,Its a good product in the basic range. Not that fast to work on.
corvidmortum,4,Decent tablet,good tablet for day to day use. Not for those who want HD everything but shows decent video in SD.
Juancarlos,4,Awesome tablet,The tablet is good for the price is really being sold
Spartaking,4,Decent pad for basic use,The fire is a decent pad for basic uses. The only downside is the way the fire automatically links with your Amazon account. Also the ads are annoying and clearly designed to increase your Amazon purchases more than anything else.
AngieMax,5,Great value!,"This is an excellent tablet for someone who just needs something simple and doesn't want to spend a lot of money. One of my favorite features is the fact that there is a memory card slot, which means that you can have virtually endless memory. This was an important feature for me since my iPad does not allow that."
JFresh,4,"Once you figure out Parental Control, its great.","The speed the great. The Kindle Fire has a lot of apps to choose from and has not frozed on me yet. Once you figure out the Parental Control, it works great with unwanted charges."
coach0064,5,Great tablet for the money,I recently purchased this tablet as a backup to my IPad. I find myself using it as much as my more expensive tablet!!!
zarqa,5,it's amazing,i bought for my niece and really amazing and working very good.

LunaDreams,5,Pefect starter!,"Decided to get this tablet for my nephews 4th birthday present. Was a great choice. Easy for him to use and navigate, great speakers, and cool programs for kids. Very happy I got him this one out of the others I was looking in to. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants their computer, table, or cellphones back from the little ones. Lol :)"
azron,4,It's my 3rd one and I needed the updated version,"I use it for lots of games, books , etc and love it"
CFJPop,4,Great for kids,"Got one for each of my kids. They use it to play games, watch movies, read and do homework"
dentwin,5,Great tablet,"Amazon Fire way surpassed my expectations. I have an IPad but wanted something smaller to read my emails and view videos while I was at work.I'm also able to view excel spreadsheet, without having to purchase another program. Battery has decent power too."
user,5,Great kids tablet,"Got this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it, it is hard to beat for the price."

Mscute16,4,Ges the Job Done,"Purchased for my niece as a gift. She's 2, so to watch her online videos, this is perfect!"
Fufu,5,Awesome for kids,I have four siblings and it keeps them quiet days they're home
DartVal,3,It is a good value for the price,"We switched from an older model tablet to this simplified Kindle Fire. For the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.The primary user in the house used it to read before bed. He feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his books/documents to black screen. However, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. Doh!He also doesn't like the persistence of the Washington Post popping up on his Home Screen. He finds it a bit annoying. However, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from Amazon at all. it is just the Washington Post that he doesn't like.Beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader. Being Amazon Prime customers, we share content between our accounts with ease now that we both are on Kindle platform."
Sassy920,5,Great tablet for its size,It is perfect for everything I need to be able to do on the go.
LushPush,4,Nice and cheap tablet overall,"I ordered this tablet as a cheap replacement for my niece, but quickly found out how well made the tablet is. Not only that the version of android it uses is smoother than i expected. Nice tablet."
Gibbles13,4,Great starter tablet,Great tablet if your looking for something easy to set up and use! !
JesseG,5,"Great Buy, Really Nice","Wanted a nice Reader, this is it for under $50!!!!"
Mommie,5,Awesome,"I purchased this item during the Black Friday at Best Buy, not only was it dirt cheap at the time of the purchase, But my kids also love it as well. The great thing is that I am also able to monitor what they download and purchase without me having to get the tablet."
jet1,4,Great tablet for the beginner...,If your not sure of what your needs are..The Fire is a good place to start..
Andrew20,4,Good tablet,It's a good little tablet but just a little annoying because of the ads on the lock screen to make us have to pay more for the tablet to get a tablet that doesn't have the ads on the lock screen is kind of ridiculous. So for that reason I only gave it 4 stars it's a good tablet does what they say it does but don't like the fact that you have to pay extra to get a tablet that is ad free.
Creese,4,Great size for reading,Very happy with the overall design and the many options the fire has as far as the ability to assess different apps
tnelson,5,Great for kids,I bought this for my granddaughter so she could have it to watch movies and play games. She loves it and takes it everywhere she goes. It is way better than a leap pad and it can grow with her.
Themetedundar,4,A tablet for your kid,It is a cheap tablet. It is not for you but a very good option for little kids
Petey,5,Great tablet for kids.,i purchased the tablet for my son and he has pleasantly delighted with it up to this point.
Js123,3,Great tablet easy tip use,Great tablet fast and great resolution. Great with prime membership
britt,4,Good beginners tablet,"Easy access to books and the web, just annoying ads."
ladydm,5,Awesome,"I really regret taking so long purchasing the Kindle Fire. The iPad was being so hyped up to the point that I didn't think the Kindle was as good. However, the iPad is not as good because after a few years, it no longer takes updates. What's the since in purchasing such an expensive item if it can't accept life-long updates? That was the purpose of me getting a tablet instead of a regular computer."
realmadpuppy,5,cannot beat it for the price,"well worth the money, it's just a pretty well thought out tablet, the interface is designed well enough for a child to a grandmother to use with relative ease.it's also powerful enough to play a great variety of fun, good looking games. which is pretty amazing at this price point."
Betti,4,Good 4 what its used 4,Average good 4 playibg games has a tendency to freeze
Duck,3,Glorified eReader,"I purchased this for my mother to use primarily to check Facebook and watch Netflix. I was a little bit disappointed to find out that there was not a Vudu app available. I hope that one is in the development stages. I knew that this was not a full out tablet when I bought it, but had hoped that since it was based on Android, it would have the major Android apps."
Pixie,5,Love it so much!!,I love this kindle so much I decided to by one for my daughter who is going to Europe. She will be able to download books and videos to watch on her long flight!!
Curly,4,great,Easy to useBattery life is goodEasy to read a book

Eugene,5,For the money this is awesome,"For the money, this is one of the nicest Kindle Readers I have seen. This is so powerful, I can do a lot more than read books."
Spacer67,4,Suits my needs very well,"This is my first tablet, and I have had for just a short while. So far, it seems to be a great product for the price. I plan to use it primarily as a reader, which will allow me to stop accumulating books in my small apartment! So the small form factor seems to fit that purpose, and it's a bonus to have a browser and the availability of lots of apps too."
Shwasim,4,Decent tablet for price,"Not the best tablet out there by Amazon, bt definitely worth the price. Can do all the basic functions of an android tablet. Great for media and entertainment purposes."
todo2le,5,great price,we bought the amazon fire for my daughter. works great
Malapivo,5,Amazon Fire,Love the Fire! Great for everything I need! Great screen and clear picture!

NaveenKumar,5,Affordable. Works Great,"This is ideal for the gift. For the price, the performance is satisfactory. Loads of apps and games. Definitely, this tablet is for everyone. Perfect for browsing, gaming, music, and learning.Battery comes okay. Build quality is satisfactory. For the price range, it is must to have."
Jwith0930,4,Great tablet for kids,The tablet is about worth what you pay for it. But that's what happens when you only pay 50.

Aim7,5,Great tablet and great price. I couldn't be happie,"I love this tablet,great for reading and keeping up with my emails."
delliott14,3,Good beginner tablet,"I mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine. Great for social media as well. A perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology. Definitely buy a decent sized micro SD card when you get it though, as the real space you receive after purchase is more like 4 GB because the OS takes so much space on the device."
Mssmoni,5,Great affordable tablet,This is a great easy to use tablet! Very affordable!
ras72,4,Inexpensive tablet,"Bought to use as a reader on flights. Lightweight, great reader, more functionality than I would have expected for the price"
RobinMCruce,5,"Best 7"" Kindle ever",I purchased this because I can add memory to it...and it's the best Kindle I've bought so far (this is about the fifth one I've purchased)...I like it so much that I bought one for my kids as well!
Missy,5,Great tablet,Bought this for my 9 year old. She loves it! Very durable and easy to use. Price is great!
Peaches,5,Love it,I bought it for granddaughter so she would leave my tab alone and it worked my tab is mine again
shopper,4,Good value for a tablet,"Was looking for a simple tablet to use during my commute. This fits the bill. App store is limited, but this is good for simple web surfing or watching videos. Lightweight too. Only thing I don't like are the ads on the unlock screen (but, this is minor considering the price)."
JewelD,5,Kindle Fire,"The Kindle Fire 7"" is a very nice reader. I love how small and light it is."
Firetv,5,Great tablet for the price,"For the price, this tablet is great! Does what is needed and its sleek."
CaliFire,5,Loving It,"I've had this tablet for a week now and I love it. Im not the most gadgetly inclined person but I do know what I wanted/needed from a tablet and I must say my expectations have been met & exceeded. When the price drops again to what I paid for it, im definitely buying another. Christmas shopping never starts too early!!"
Lizzie956,5,Great product,"Bought it for my mom, she like to play games in her tablet is it is perfect."
NYJOHNNY,4,Great to take,"The FIRE goes where you go. The greatest attribute is the size, perfect to bring everywhere!!"
dsbb,5,Great Value,"This tablet is a great value for the price. You can have multiple accounts on the same tablet, and pick which apps are available on the account for your kid."
Marchy,4,Decent Phone,Good for teens that use it primarily for gaming/videos
John,5,Great for the price,Bought this for our 9 year old daughter and she loves it! Easy to use and kid friendly.
mark,1,worked fine for a month or so did not use it much,"I purchased one as a Christmas gift. from Best Buy on line...it worked fine the first month,did not use it for a few weeks. I went to turn it on..did not get nothing .The lefthand bottom corner says ""FASTBOOTH mode"" It is locked on this and I get nothing else.Did not buy any product protection so I guess it is a complete loss."
granny,5,Grandkids,They love it and when they are here that's all they want to do but I do limit their time on it.
Beetle,4,Nice price,Bought for a friend and checked it out after purchase is a very neat machine.
GAPINDY,3,"Decent hardware, not the best Android experience","I bought this when it was on sale, and my rewards coupon was expiring so I felt I didn't have much to lose. Overall, this tablet is a good value, but you have to be careful about certain aspects.The tablet is really fast for something in this price range. The screen has pretty good resolution as well. There is no Bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.The app store is the Amazon app store. I side loaded Google Play and am getting my apps from there (YouTube helpful for instructions). The lock screen is an Amazon billboard. The default search is Bing instead of Google. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet. I just use the Google app to search Google. You can load the Chromecast app from Play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. It works for YouTube and Flixter, but it doesn't work for any Disney Apps (Watch ESPN, Watch ABC, etc.). You can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.I think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and I can now watch my Prime Movies on it. Still, it's not the tablet you would expect from an Android device. My satisfaction would improve greatly if Chromecast worked better."
360cabot,5,Great Kindle,"This is the second Kindle i have had. This has all the features that i need-It has my email, it is easy to read, it is easy to take wherever I go, it also has the books on it that i love to read. It has the further capability of taking pictures and has its own calendar. I recommend it to anyone."
mrfusion,4,Great Tablet for a Great unbelievable Price,"Hands down you can't go wrong with this tablet. Especially if its on sale and lower than the normal $50 retail price. Sure some google apps might not be in the market place, but a majority are and if your looking for just another tablet for mobile games or another screen for Netflix or Hulu this tablet would do just fine."
Nelly,3,Ok for the price,Like it. Worth the 50 $ just wish it only had a real Google play store
IshGhai,5,Excellent,I am using it from Nov'15 and have lots of apps and games installed it just never gets hang or slow up.
gennut,5,A very helpful tool,I purchased one for myself and my mom to use for the word games & books to help enhanse her mind.
dora,4,Good for the kid,I bought it for my son. He loved it. I just don't like he can read my books at Amazon. I should be able create a sub account and limit it.
Neatgear,4,Good one...,Its a good one for the normal songs and video viewing...
queenpiglet0629,5,good value,"Most tablets i've tried really stink, but this one is ok. Wish it had google though."
Gigi,5,Great product,"Wonderful product!! User friendly and if help is needed, online support is available."
Nikkipoo,4,Great Gift,I bought this for my niece for her 9th birthday and she loves it! I would recommend it if you have kids
ElectronicsMike,3,Great for kids or first time tablet user,"This tablet screen and memory is lackluster at best but other than that if you are replacing another one of the Kids tablets or giving a gift to an older family member this is the way to go. The video on Amazon website shows a better picture while streaming video, Amazon ""One touch"" is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchases unless you don't mind a lot of $2.99 purchases. In short they make it too easy to purchase items by mistake. I thought I was on Prime video and notice that I was charged for an episode of Warehouse 13. Since I didn't see the show and caught this quickly I was able to chat with Amazon Customer Care and they walked me through how to change that setting online. This tablet not for me since I'm looking for a higher end media tablet with more memory than the 8GB this unit has."
Mtfdben,5,Very nice tablet for the price,We wanted something you could read books on and watch shows through amazon and hulu. This meets those needs and then some.
Gabe,5,Great for the price,This is a good product for reading and browsing Internet.
Redbird,5,Love the tablet,The tablet is just the right size. The games are fun and has so many other uses
granny1,5,Easy to use even with arthritis,The ease of the touch screen makes for easy use with arthritis old granny nurse
smcddg,5,Best value,Best bang for the buck. Can't be beat for reading. The best bookstore and readers experience.
Toya,3,Ok,It's ok I would recommend it to friends for sure in the future
jabberingpanda,5,Great product for Average Consumer!,"First off you can't go wrong with the price, $50 (or if you can even catch it on sell) is a steal for any piece of Tech. Now I've seen people compare this to an ipad or samsung tablet, which you can't. This doesn't have retina display or anything like that, But for the price point it does a good job. I've had mine since the black firday sell and its still been working really good. I also got one for my mom and my nephew. I generally use mine for emails and amazon orders along with reading the time to time book, netflix, and the few games that I've purchased. My mom and nephew use it mainly to play games. If your looking for retina display or something with apple or andriod features and don't mind the extra $150 or $300 bucks by all means I suggest getting one of the higher end tablets. But I can't complain with this new Amazon fire 7 as it works just as good for me. I'd recommend buying a sd card however if you want a little extra space."
Nelle,5,Perfect tablet,Love my Kindle! It's perfect for my Netflix obsession late at night! Great size and picture quality!
Wolfmanphil,4,small and convenient,I like the size it fits right in my pocket and its not bulky
Lamar,5,Great Product,This Amazon-Fire 7 is on fire meaning that it is a Hot Buy at Best Buy. It does everything I need it to do. Haven't had any problems.
Love,5,Good tablet for the money,It's work very well for a child got for my 8 year old she love it
Arun,4,Good tab for the price. Works great.,The tab is very good for the price what is being offered. Allows to have separate kid profile as well so that they don't have access to unwanted stuff. YouTube app can be installed as well.
MichelleV,5,Really great basic tablet,i bought this tablet because I didn't want to spend over a 100$ on a tablet that would not get much use. I use it mostly to read books and articles online. It has a brightness reducing function which is really great.
HappyCustomer,4,Good Tablet For Kids. Great Parental Controls,One thing I like most about the kindle fire product line are the extensive parental controls. The game play seems to be good and movie playback is as well. My kids love theirs...
Polo,4,Good for the right price,Is a great tablet the only bad thing is the lack of space and you have to buy an SD card for extra space
Cheechu821,3,Great product for its price,I purchased the tablet as a screen for my drink and it worked just fine
Smizer,5,Great price for upgrading memory,I love this tablet for alot of reasons..Expandable memory slot of up to 128 mb SD card for music in the car an anywhere..Netflix for every1 in the family.Perfect for the 3 year olds phonics an movie time..
Nana,5,Great tablet for a beginner,"Have always been pleased with BEST BUY, and will continue to purchase all of my equipment there."
Medmom,4,Great for travel,Wanted a reader that I could just get and go on my way. Always have something to read. Apps are great. Easy for my 7 yr old grandson to enjoy too.
Candy,5,Perfect size,My 3 year old son loves it he will not put it down for the world!
S500ivan,5,Cool tablet !!,"This is a great tablet at a affordable price!! It's perfect for the kids and as well for adults, what you waiting for? Go to Best Buy and get one!"
TGoo,4,Picture Quality,Not that great but a good tablet. No problems yet.
TraceeA,5,I love my Kindle Fire.,I was looking for a tablet that I could carry in my purse. This Kindle Fire is perfect. I pair it with my hotspot and I'm online in a jiffy. Saves my phone data. I love it.
Hwild2001,5,Awesome tablet,This kindle is awesome. Great picture fast internet.
Laxman,4,Great for children,Large enough it is not a strain on my child's eyes. In two days my three year old figured it out. Great for her to watch her shows and play games. Have not used it much past setting it up.
ChuckNorris,3,Great for Amazon only users,Bought this to replace a broken tablet hoping it would work for a replacement. Unless you are amazon everything. Google apps aren't easily installed on this tablet. Otherwise it's a great value for the money.
Destiny,4,Better upgrade,My son had the same Model kindle but a year later his kindle had issues. This kindle has a micro sd slot for storage. I haven't tested it out yet. I plan on testing it out to see if I can load movies on the micro sd
Susan,4,Good to read books on,When I was looking for something to get so I could have all my books on one the Kindle is the first thing I thought of and ended up getting. The only thing I don't like about it is when it is dark the screen can be kind of bright even with the blue shade on. I also I have trouble spelling on the keyboard.
Derek,5,Good Tablet,Its a quick fast little tablet. Can do a lot of stuff a normal tablet does.
RAH2,5,good tablet,"Very good tablet, great options and features for the price."
Russellthecrow,5,Great tablet for Amazon Prime members,"Bought this for my daughter for her birthday and linked it to my Amazon Prime Account so she can get free books, music, and movies. She loves it."
Dean,4,Great Tablet for price,This tablet is a great price. Perfect for those who use Amazon and want to use Amazon apps.Don't let the low price and screen size fool you. Works flawlessly. It has long battery life and a bright display. This is a must-have item for $50.
Merchantman,5,Exactly what you expect,Exactly what you expect from this product. Great for it's price.
Keisha,5,Great product,I love it!!! This product has been awesome for my 8 year old
Lupe,1,Poor,The kindle fire I purchased does not work. It does not start or charge.
LadyKD,5,My kids love these,This is a excellent item for kids. And better then spending 100+ for another tablet.
JayN,4,Using it to play pandora all day,"It works great. We are using it to play pandora music all day at the store. So far, we don't have any issue. It works very consistently."
Faith,5,great tablet!,My mother-in-law loves her tablet! I purchased it at a great price as well.
john,4,An amazing bargain,"This isn't a great tablet. Obviously. It's not even a pretty good tablet. What it is, is a really solid tablet that, at $35, is basically disposable. I take this thing places where it might get stolen or broken, because if it does... I'm only out $35. Consequently I use it a lot more because it's not so precious. Also, the ability to download movies from Prime and watch them off line, makes this guy the perfect subway tablet."
mmnc,4,Surprisingly Good,"This is a great tablet, if you keep your expectations in check. Is it going to rival the likes of the iPad or even the 2013 Nexus 7? No. But there is a lot of junk in the $50-100 tablet market. Thankfully the new Kindle Fire isn't one of these. The screen quality is adequate for reading and watching youtube, netflix, and hulu. I had multiple apps open and it didn't feel too bogged down. If you can find it when it is on sale for $39.99, it's an even bigger steal."
NKKC,4,Nice and simple tablet,"Good tablet for simple use like reading books, music and simple tasks."
NicoNana,5,Great tablet for my grandson,I bought this tablet for my grandson who loves it. He can download books to read and play games as well. He carries it with him wherever he goes. Has really enjoyed having his own tablet.
knowyourtech,4,Great easy use tablet,"Great tablet for simple reading, web surfing without too many features"
MovieFan,5,Awesome!!,"Battery life is good, surprisingly awesome product with low memory. Lots to do with it/on it... very satisfied purchase"
Steph,5,Under $40 Great gift idea,Purchased 2 of these Black Friday from our local Best Buy and gave them as gifts for xmas. Both people thought we spent a lot of money but we made out like bandits for under $40 each. GREAT PRODUCT ! Great gift for not a lot of money for anyone who your considering their first tablet. You can't go wrong here.
Magic,3,Ok but i expected more.,Movee very slow but it is ok for the price that i paid for it.
mchazelett,4,few issues,When my kids play a game on their profile the system goes to the screensaver. My dad's doesn't do this so it may just be a software issue on mine. But altogether I do love having the Fire.
buddy,1,Does not meet my needs,Can not print from this device...Using the touch screen is very difficult.
Mmboo,4,Great tablet for kids,"As inexpensive as this tablet is, it is a great option for children. Each of my kids has one. If they damage it, you aren't out a ton of money like an iPad. Freetime is also a great option to help control apps and time each child is on the kindle."
GrammyH,5,Perfect for seniors,My husband and I each own this Kindle. You will never find us without them at hand for gaming or email. My bff always complained that I was addicted. Guess what I got herfor a birthday present! So who's the addict now!
Chris,5,Excellent,"Does everything I need really well. I do both of my email accounts, read all of the news and sports I want, and do light research. It's plenty fast and the screen resolution is just fine. Amazing for the price."
Malibumary,5,Great reader,I had wanted a kindle for a very long time. When I saw the price I could not resist
Paul,4,Great basic reader with a few extras.,Of you're looking for a tablet with all the bells and whistles this may not be for you. If your looking for a great reader with easy access to all Amazon has to offer at an affordable price this may be what you're looking for.
itsRaychL,3,Okay for Starter,"I think this tablet is better for simple usage. Not so much for a whole lot of apps and games, as the memory is used up SUPER FAST for only being 8GB (when in reality you don't get the full 8GB to begin with). I got this for my 7yr old daughter and the apps eat up the memory which eventually slow down the tablet and make it kick off the wifi because there isn't enough memory for it to fully function. You pretty much HAVE to get a memory card for it with atleast 16GB or more. But for a starter and for basic stuff...checking social media etc it's fine. And for a starter tablet for kids."
Lucky,3,Easy to get around,"This is a great product and I did research it before buying 3 of them. Having said that, I didn't realize the apps such as Instagram and Madden mobile, we're not available on Amazon. This was a BIG disappointING factor for the young people using the product. The other big complaint we have with this product is the length of the charging cord. WAY TOO SHORT."
ShakenNotStirred,4,great product for price,Purchased one for my mother who likes to read a lot but not really internet savy. She loves it. And cannot beat the price. she uses it mainly for reading however. I bought it on Black Friday for under $50.00
busymom,4,got this as a replacement for my daughter,had to return a digiland tablet that I got for my daughter for Christmas and best buy didn't have another digiland so they let me get the kindlefire instead of the digiland. My daughter likes it all except for the fact that she can't get the google play games that I have on my tablet.
hobo,5,great for the price,"great little tablet for price, great if have amazon prime"
davebo1967,5,Great Value Perfect!,Best Buy makes it easy. No problems. I am a Best Buy Geek.
str8Blessed,5,Fire is a great all around tablet!,"Kindle Fire 7"" is affordable for everyone!$! Love it!!!"
DWatl,5,Awesome,I love it. Great product.My son loves it. It is great for kids and adults.
SueAnn,5,Pleasantly Surprised,Best gift for my 10yr. old. Even uses it for homework.
LeaP,4,Nice tablet for price,I enjoy this tablet and will buy another one for my daughter to use.
Jnmalone111,1,A very disappointing Tablet,"I picked up this tablet thinking it would be a great buy. I have a few family members that own the previous model of the kindle fire and highly approve of them. The new product I got was very disappointing, The display had a dead pixel on it when I turned it on. The product is very slow and the cameras leave a lot to be desired. I took it back and exchanged for an IPad Mini 4 and am very happy with it."
chris,5,great tablet for the price,"It's not really an Android device as everything is Amazon centric. Not a massive problem unless you want to integrate with Google products such as ChromeCast. You also can't switch off tracking features and use add blockers, the lock screen even has an advert! However if you can put up with that then it is a great little tablet with excellent performance."
Media,3,S'allright,Bought this tab for the $40 dollar sale price and its a nice little system. Nothing worthy of note though I have to say I am not a fan of the amazons operating system. My wife hates the inability to delete preinstalled bloatware so the home-screen is not OCD friendly.
milasoto,3,Nice tablet for the price but not a lot of memory,"It is a nice tablet for the price. The camera is not that great but it is decent. Beware of the memory capacity though. It says that it holds 8 gb but only has 3.81 gb of free space, so less than half."
lizziekirko,4,like it,"I had purchased a Fire HD about a year ago from Amazon so this was a second. It is not in constant use, but I can take the pictures of receipts when I need them, and have it as a inexpensive backup. Backups are really important."
Tammy,1,Terrible crashed after downloading apps,Luckily best buy exchanged the kindle fire for a Lenovo tablet with courtesy and ease. Thank you best buy! It was a black Friday purchase that I did nothing with until late January/ early February. Great way to do business and therefore keep it.
Jamegame,5,Great product!,Bought a gift for my mom. She absolutely loved it! Great purchase. Great price! No complaints.
Jerseymike,5,Great tablet for everyday use,Great display and colors easy to use. Very good entry level tab great price seems to be very durable great apps. Would recommend to anyone wanting entry level tablet.
docrutherford,5,Kindle Fire,"This is my second purchase of a Kindle Fire, an upgrade from the original, which failed due to unintentional very rough handing by this user. It is an excellent device with significant improvements over the original. My only issue is that a particular app that I routinely used apparently was only available on the original and is not available on the latest model."
Lilbit,5,Great tablet for the price,"We had an older Kindle that needed to be upgraded. This is the same quality for less than half the price!! Love it and has a camera, our old one did not."
Audrey,5,Great tablet for kids,My daughter loves her tablet and it's great for movies and games!

Techgeek17,5,Great tablet for the price,I purchased 3 tablets as gifts for family members. The price was great and the quality is outstanding. The video and sound are impressive for the value. Wonderful tablet at a low price.
Blurayhawk522,4,Great product for the price,The price is outstanding it works great for my use surfing the web. Little slow and the image is not super sharp but you can't beat the price. if you're looking for an inexpensive tablet this one is great!!

Schmoltz,5,Great tablet.,Seamless transition from old device. Easy to use. Completely happy.
ReverendGamer,4,Can't beat it for $50,"If you're expecting something like an iPad, leave your expectations at the door. This is a great little tablet for losing track of time while you read, play a game, connect with family/friends, or watch a show. I've had iPads for years, and have loved using them--just getting tired of the price tags that come with them."
Kels,4,nice entry-level tablet,Love it nice parental controls but be careful screen will crack.
richie,4,inexpensive for playing games.,Generally it is good. Sometimes the touch screen does not respond well.

Rohit,5,great Tablet for the price,I got it on black friday. Its a great tablet for Kids or your additional backup tablet for games or reading books. Ad's on the lock screen was annoying.
bbshopper,5,Everyone enjoying,This is an amazing item for the money. Cheaper then my first scientific calculator many years ago.
dragongirl,5,Not just a reader,"I have older versions of the kindle fire, and I bought this one to replace my daughter's ""aging"" kindle-which she uses constantly. This one has 2 camera phones, one rear and one front, compared to her one that has just one (rear). Also, the graphics are better and it has more MG than her old one, which is great because she pretty much maxed out her other one. She uses it to read, play games, and do homework (even can check her grades online). All around, it is quick to turn on rather than using a computer to get what she needs for easy homework (online research, calculator, etc.) and a lot more portable when traveling!"
swagger,4,I like the tablet. Just the right size.,"I like the fire tablet. It is great for checking emails, playing games, etc. Without the expensive cost."
Sheila,4,Amazon Fire Tablet,"I bought this for my son to have access to Netflix and a few games. Although I think the parental controls are too complicated, I really like the tablet."
JimHoam,2,Good for kids,The processor was so slow. It took about five minutes to load a five minute YouTube video with 50 Mb/min. Internet.
jayjjm60,5,got for my daughter,Excellent value great apps and movies. the price was perfect.
eericksen,4,Amazon Fire,This was a good investment. That being said do yourself a favor and buy a SD Micro card and add it on before you download anything. Makes it run that much smoother
Jayd107,5,Great tablet for the money,"This is a great budget tablet. Don't expect it to compare to an iPad, but it's great for the kids!"
Geli,4,Great tablet,A great tablet to read books on Amazon for prime members.
Bsjodin,4,Simple to use,"Nice, simple great deal for the money. Good buy, would recommend."

charlie68,5,great tablet!!,Perfect size for travel so kids can be entertained in the car and checking emails and watching shows and reading e-books very convenient for mom's on the go. worth the every cent
veryberry917,4,Loved gift item!,"The person I bought this for really loved the product, it was compact enough to carry to the beach, yet large enough to read from. The price when purchased was amazing and you can't beat it for speed and ease of using."
philly,4,seems ok,Seems ok but not what i really needed. I'm not much of a reader
Flash,5,Great Deal,The tablet is durable and great for kids. The best part is the parental control.

sirfresh,5,Love It!,I purchased this TAB as a gift for a family member. They are very happy with this product and it's features. The applications that come with this product are great. Happy to be a part of the amazon fire family.
DRock,4,Great gift for kids.,My kids loved it. They use it daily. I would recommend to any parent.
LuckyC,5,The surprising hit of the holidays...!,"I purchased this tablet after seeing the Best Buy ad...I got it for my wife for Christmas this past December. The price was unbelievable (under $50!) and even though my wife didn't think she'd ever use or want one, I said, ""What the heck!"" and bought it anyway. Well, she's been using it nightly (during the week) and quite a bit more on weekends--in fact, she's used it more than anything else I've ever given her in the past!"
Kingpat,5,Easy to use,Very easy and dependable. It fits perfect in a purse or pocket to take to work to use on breaks.
Xstobbi,5,Loved it,Bought it for my niece over the Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Was worried about the quality since it was so cheap but it turned out great. As a matter of fact the quality was fantastic and easy to use too. Money well spent.
shopgirl42,5,It is a wonderful tablet.,I really enjoy using the Fire 7 tablet. It is light weight and fits in my purse for caring around. Now I always have a good book to read.
grandma,4,love the kindle fire,I buy kindle fires for my grandchildren. They are between the ages of 6 to 10 years old. They seem kid friendly and easy to use.
Boughtformykids,5,Great table for the price,Bought for my kids for Christmas and they both love them. Bought one for each kid.
RhymePays,4,Solid device for consuming Amazon content,"There is a good amount of value in this device, particularly if you consume content from Amazon. I bought this tablet for my daughter but her primary source of content is YouTube and there is a dearth of quality YouTube apps on the Amazon app store. She mostly uses an old iPhone 4 for this purpose when at home. On the road, however, I am sure she will use the Fire tablet with movies and Prime content loaded up on the microSD card. It is a solid device - I have not encountered any glitches, freezes, or app crashes but it is not used as much as our other devices. I would recommend it if you consume Prime content or you are clumsy with electronics.Pros* Good value (almost disposable)* microSD slot* Underground* Multi-user support* Easy access to Prime contentCons* Amazon's Fire UI* Amazon's App Store* No support for Google apps such as YouTube, Gmail, etc.* Battery life could be better* No stock content producing apps like iMovie, GarageBand, etc/"
KindleFireIsJUNK,1,SPAM Edition,SPECIAL OFFERS means there are popup ads when you turn on the Kindle for games and books. I called amazon and they want me to pay $15.99 to turn this off! I am returning this and buying another brand of tablet. I am DONE with amazon they will never get a dime from me!
Style,4,Great for the kids!,The kids love them! I purchased some tablets the year before off Amazon and they were cheap and broke quick I spent the same on these this last Christmas and they seem sturdier and better picture quality!
Tmf5,4,Great product for the price.,"Bought to replace my original kindle and have access to books already purchased. Have used it for so much more like games, browsing internet, and watching netflix. Does so much more than original at a better price."

smalbers21,5,Great for kids,Bout this for my step-son. Easy to use and durable.
timm,5,bought as a gift,"bought this as a gift so i can't speak on how it functions. however, i researched all kinds of tablets online before purchasing this and it was a great deal"
Garre4,4,Decent tablet,Not much negative to say other than I don't like how you buy an Amazon card to put on the tablet and yet they still require a credit card.
tlowe91,5,Great Tablet,Bought this tablet one for my daughter and one for my nephew. They seem to enjoy it a lot.

sabu,5,Bought it for my 3 yr old,"Now I don't have to feel guilty bringing my Kindle to work,he can play his games and watch his videos."
pure59,4,Great for our kiddos,"We bought these tablets for our children ages 5 through 10 for gameplay so they could stay off of my Samsung tablet. Hallelujah! They absolutely love them! The only problem that I have with tablet is the length of the cord on the charger. It's too short. If you want to continue play while it's charging, you have to literally sit right next to the electrical source. We remedied this problem by exchanging the cord for a longer one that we had around the house."
Wintermaple,5,Great tablet for my three kids,"It's great - each of my kids received one last month for Christmas (ages 8, 12, 15). We gave it to them mostly for reading and they love them. Yes the younger two game on them and watch their shows as well, but most of the time I ""catch"" them reading. I thought the ads would bug them but they only appear when you initially turn on the device and that's it. No one's said a thing. Good screen quality too. We purchased a 32g SD card for each tablet for more storage."
Mikeymike,4,pretty cool tablet,It was pretty cheap and you can surf the web. a good buy for the bucks.
Jenn,3,Okay tablet for the price,"Works okay for what we paid. Not super speedy, quality is a little grainy as well"

Baconcheese,4,Great tablet for novice,Great tablet for those new to tablets or just goofing around on
dave,5,execelent product,Very good and easy to handle the price was very good
btschuster,5,Great tablet at a great price,"This is a great tablet and you can't beat the price. I bought it to use with Amazon Prime Videos, but I now find myself using it for much more. The built in email client works great. If you want, and do a little research, it is easy to either side load apps from the Google PlayStore, or install the store app itself, allowing you to install the few apps that don't appear in the Amazon App Store."
Kiki,4,I like the placement of the camera on this Kindle.,"the price was right and I wanted it for it's ease, because I will be using it in my door to door ministry. thank you,"
Santa,3,Great piece for the price if it works correctly.,This item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge. We may have to return. I assume it is this unit and not all.
zcraig7,5,Awesome picture quality,I bought two of these for black friday and the kids love them
Captain,5,Love the Fire,4th Fire we have owned. My daughter uses it mostly

Juba,5,Awesome,"Use it every night to watch amazon television in bed, play games, read books. Great item."
Tuck,4,Kid Friendly,I bought two of these during black Friday for my boys and they love them.
Nate,5,"Great, Affordable tablet",This Amazon Fire Tablet is a great tablet and very affordable.
Jess79,5,Love it,I bought this for my son's first tablet. I really like the product. Like the parental controls. For him I am not thrilled that with any parental controls he can't have free access to the web. It's blocked mostly :(.Needs a bit more memory so get an SD card. I would rate it lower because of this. But for what I paid I just cant. The graphics on Netflix are good. I can't come up with one reason for the price to give it less than stars. I own a IPAD and it rivals it. Especially for the price difference.
jri6006,4,great tablet,very nice tablet. very fast for the price. camera takes good quality pictures.
TriciaW,5,Love my New Tablet,"I love my new tablet. The size is just right and love that I can access the internet or play games anytime, anywhere!"

gc77441,5,Bought this for our 8yr old son,He loves it. Using it with the Amazon Free Time app. Son uses is constantly. Easy to set up and use. Easy to keep kids from making purchases or accessing content outside of the Free Time app.
Peach,5,Very happy,"Bought this for my grandson for Christmas, I also own one. We both like this product"
01bandit12,5,Good features for young children.,Very happy with this tablet. My grandchildren love it!!

RicardoR,4,Great tablet,"I bought this tablet for a Christmas for a family member gift even thought I wasn't too sure of the quality of this tablet because it was very inexpensive. The person who received the tablet was very satisfied with the speed, screen resolution and apps."
D2W2,4,Perfect for what I needed!,"This was on such a good deal that I couldn't resist it. I purchased two of these for my 6 and 3 year old children. They don't need anything grand, but this is more than suitable for them to learn, play, and enjoy some technology. It performs well and I hope it continues to last."
philric,5,Perfect gift,This tablet is a really good value. Gave it as a gift and it was a hit!
wndll,1,A physical commercial,"Bought these for my kids for the holidays. No you tube app installed, so you have to find a 3rd party substitute. Ads pop up all the time, with an option to remove them for $15. Amazon states that since I purchased the tablet on sale for $15, this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue. I would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt.Maybe a good product, but not for us."
Wellington,5,Good tablet,"Good tablet for the price. It is fast, battery life is ok."
zeiferx,5,doesnt get better for the price,this amazon fire table is a great bargain. its not a top of the line table and you can tell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price does a whole lot! day to day regular use or just for kids and people that dont really care about some extra features that flagship tablet bring its amazon!
bear,4,great little tablet,"great tablet to use around the house, and on the go . my wife like to read alot"

Jifx3,4,Great item! Great price!,My kids love this tablet! All the fun without the steep price!
Carlos,5,Very good tablet for the money,"I have to admit that I was quite surprised by this Amazon Fire tablet. I have been using Apple, Windows, and Android for the past few years and never gave Amazon a chance - until a Black Friday deal at Best Buy.It is responsive, visually great, and the OS is quite easy to navigate. I set this up with my younger son in mind, and the parental controls are superb. They covered everything I could think of to prevent him from doing. Amazon also has plenty of cases to choose from for their own tablets.The only thing, and this just may take time, is that I wish the app library was more extensive compared to Apple and Android. Other than that, everything else is Excellent!"
WOW1,1,Not for kids,I bought the Fire for my 8 year old for school after a suggestion from the sales rep in store. Went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered. Couldn't even download free kids apps. Why would I want my child able to accidently buy something? I refused and thus not able to download anything. We will be returning it. Product appears best for an adult who likes to read books on tablet.
Jack,5,Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black,"great tablet, we love it, great for family with kids"
gatortator,4,Great basic.............I think,"The biggest drawbacks to this product is the lack of any instructions/user manuals included with the package. You are forced to experiment with the controls to boot it up and start using it........if you are adventurous and PC oriented, it's no problem.........if you aren't.......good luck."
danababy50,5,LOVE IT,THIS ITEM IS ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I MADE THIS SEASIN. I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT
tete,4,great tablet for the price,"Bought the tablet for my niece. She loves it, a lot"
Fire,5,Great tablet,Grandma loves it..plays her games and keeps up with the grandkids.
SpankyLarue,5,Great Tablet for the price,"A nice tablet for the price. No a-lot of meaningful competition at this price range, which makes the Fire tablet an easy selection for the price conscious buyer."
jb111,5,Excellent Tablet,"Excellent Tablet for beginners and kids. The cameras and expandable memory are a big plus and this tablet is a steal at the price. Its not for everyone, you get what you pay for"
photodena,5,Great Tablet,This tablet is the perfect size and power for any work or home use.
DeathProof89,5,Amazon!,Great tablet for the price! Highly Recommended! Comes with ads is the only downside
Babygirl2,4,"For the price, this can't be beat.","Very hard to setup, but once thats done it works remarkably well."
SandyD,4,Nice Tablet,"It took a moment to figure out how to set it up, but once that was complete, it works amazingly. It is a little smaller than I prefer."
TT212,5,Good budget tablet,Good beginner/budget tablet. Worth the price. Happy with my purchase.
maf1021,5,great gift,The perfect tablet for a beginner. Also at the super low price its hard to find a better bargain.
Bonnie,5,Easy to use tablet,Love the ease of using the Kindle. This version also has a built in camera!
CampGirl,5,Loving my Fire,Bought the Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet on a BF whim while standing in the checkout line. Glad I did. Nice and compact. Fast. I'm using it daily and finding I can do more with it than I thought I could.
ECCJW,5,Excellent,"Affordable, versatile and easy to use whether it is for e-reading or searching the web."
Flair,5,Great tablet for a gift,It has more features than the old rca tablet she had & has more memory & battery power plus u can get free ebooks
Tommy7999,5,Excellent Tablet,Got 2 of these for my grandsons and they love them.
MikeB,4,Awesome first tablet,My first real tablet. It works awesome for books and playing movies. Even though it is limited to only amazon apps it is fast and has a lot of free apps to play with. If your looking for a tablet to use for mostly internet I would look else where. It is limited to only one browser app that and the music play pack through headphones is kind of weak at least for my taste. Movies look & play great which is one of the things I wanted it for. Good battery life and overall quality. So for the price this is hard to beat.
LLKlovesbestbuy,5,Kids all loved them,I bought five of these for ages 4 to 14. They all loved them and were up and using them within 5 minutes. Was their favorite gift!!!
Gary,5,Awesome tablet,This new Kindle is very well built. Finally amazon got away from making the Kindles use a carousel to browse through apps. The speakers are of great quality and are very loud. This kindle is also extremely durable compared to nearly every tablet on the market. I've dropped this about 5 times already on my tile floor and there is virtually no damage.
GIGO,4,Good tablet for kids,Good basic tablet for home and the kids. The only downside is that a credit/ debit card is required to link to the Amazon store even if you download a free app. I'm able to let the kids use apps and the Internet. I can limit the sites the kids can visit and apps they can use.
Bogo6,5,Great tablet,I got this for my friend for Christmas & she was thrilled when she got it! I have an older one & use it all of the time. Very pleased with this product!
txnightangel,5,Perfect for children to adults!,"This is the best tablet I have ever owned. Everyone in my house now have one. Lightweight and perfect for reading e-books, playing games or just about anything. It even has parental controls. Very easy to use."
Bino,3,Cool tablet for the kids,This tablet is showing it's age. I bought one for my 10 year old back when he was 7 and it was cool then. Picked up two on sale for my 4 and 5 year old so they can leave my phone alone and they like it. However it's slow when downloading apps and I constantly have to plug in my pin. Battery life isn't that great either especially when they stream movies so i still have to give up my phone . Overall still a decent product hood picture and they like it.
eastsider,5,kindle,I bought it for a gift and the recipient loves it!
montiy,4,Great tablet,Great little tablet for taken on my commute to work.
Joshweber04,3,Good,The main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's no iPad. It will be great for kids mostly. The screen quality is not the best.
SamIAm,4,Great Tablet for Toddlers,We love this tablet for our toddler. The built in parental controls are awesome. Just wish that it was open to Android market outside of Amazon for more apps.
tigre,5,Great Xmas Gift,Another good buy for my daughter! Youngest one too! She enjoys being on it!!
Kelly4Casper,4,Decent tablet,"Easy to use for my non-tech sister! Screen is a little small, but it works for what she needs. Great value on ""Black Friday."""
Ansh,4,Great tablet for BF price,My requirement for this tablet was reading kindle ebooks and watching Netflix. I don't play games and no need of browsing on the table too. Bought it tablet on BF for $35 and found it to be a good value for reading. The only problem I faced is a couple of updates I received lately which have slowed down the performance a bit (that's why 4 stars). Watching Netflix is also good on this tablet.Overall worth the $35 I paid for it.
SkinnyDave,4,Gift for girls.,"Got it for daughter Christmas they love it, I haven't figured out how to run it yet."
nabbu,4,good tablet,i didn't knew about the product before i went to the best buy. Say the tablet with decent price and bought it so that i can give it as a gift. it works well.
Texas,4,Great starter tablet for young child,"Purchased this for my 8yr old son, glad I did. This is not to much for him to handle. He's reading, playing games, and he loves it."
roc21257,4,Good tablet for starters,"Good tablet for a travel companion. Good for playing games, streaming movies and as a reading tablet. Can add other apps as well. ."
Mandylynn003,4,Great Tablet,This is great tablet for anyone. It's an adriod tablet so it's different than the iPad features
Cinderella8055,4,It needs a little more updates,I bought this for my daughters for Christmas but it has some limitations and doesn't let you do some stuff the other kindles did.
shay,5,great,Great Christmas gift for a young adult. She loved it
Miriam,4,Good for the price,"Got this on a lark for my 9 yr old and mother-in-law who does not have a smart phone because of the Black Friday price. It's good for the price, but the picture quality is okay. I hope it lasts."

Justanaveragejoe,3,"Great, but has some kinks.","I purchased this tablet because I saw that it was at an affordable price point for me. With this, it's really not that bad. The only 2 things I've found to be able a little bit annoying is that it's a little awkward to hold/handle when I'm playing my games. The second issue I've found with this type of tablet is that it's made out of plastic & its noisy. The overall performance is quite impressive though. Good price point, with good intentions, just a little cheap feeling & a little big in the hands to hold."

mary,3,ok,not as good as the first kindle fire I got and ok product.
QMLW,4,Kids app is awesome,I like it for my kids and think it is a great tablet for adults too
eGyrl,4,Perfect for my Son,"I ordered this as I had already purchased one for myself and I found that my 4 year old son could use it quite easily and loved the games on it. I also has purchased the 2 year no questions asked insurance. I like that I can set time limits, when the device can wake and when it can sleep. How much time should be spent for educational work vs play or movies. I like the heft of it and not having to worry how much it costs in case either of my children decide to throw it across the room. I have a child with autism and learned the hard way that electronic devices can become air borne in a moments notice for no reason at all. So I am no longer willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet.Also, I had purchased a Galaxy Tab 4 and found that I couldn't use Amazon Apps on the secured profile side unless I installed the app on ""that"" side which would give my children access to purchasing apps. I was not going to do that which rendered any amazon apps useless on the Galaxy Tab 4. I also found that my older son wanted the Amazon apps from the Amazon underground store that my youngest son was playing. When I looked on Google Play for them, those same apps to put on the Tab 4 were $10 a piece!! Being they were Disney apps. Well, this tablet has virtually paid for itself in my opinion and now both my children are happy. I have insurance on both so I am not worried about them breaking them. I don't have to match $10 apps on another device. My children read books and watch movies, or play apps, so the internet isn't really a concern, as it is a little slow but not painful.Overall, I definitely would buy it again and I would recommend it. Very happy with my purchase as it suits my needs."

This one is a little smaller than hers, but it works wonderful. I have a lot of books downloaded & about 5 games. It has 8gb of memory so it can't handle a ton of games. It can handle those no problem. I really enjoy reading on this before bed and when I need to pass time."
ktran,5,Great tablet.,Easy to use. Easy to setup. Great video quality...

john,5,For Fifty bucks its a steal!,You can't buy a lousy no brand for this price. Kid friendly. Don't you cringe when your wife gives her brand new iPhone or iPad to the 2 year old. Download apps and a movie or two from Disney and you can have a long peaceful drive in the car with a happy child. If you've bought movies with digital copies you can download them to this device for free. You need to buy a memory chip to expand memory capacity. Plenty of free apps on amazon as well. We bought several on black Friday and have no regrets..

Saints225,4,Great for price,It's great for the price but always freezes and stalls maybe it's just nine since I put a 32gb memory card in there so it takes time to load. The price makes it worth it and the fact that you expand the memory to what you want

davidm,5,Best bang for the buck!,Very reponsive processor high quality display expandable storage up to 128gb via sd card lots of free apps via amazon app store decent battery life and inexpensive price what more can you ask for!!!
jim1974,4,great for the price.,"Im not a huge fan of the striped down android sytem. No google app store. But pretty powerful for the $35 I got it for. Plays movies , expandable memory, so-so speaker, and of course as far as e reading goes, it works."
will,4,"I like it ,it's money well spent .","I like it ,it's money well spent. I will recommend it ."
Chris,4,Decent tablet,"I bought this for my mom who didn't have a tablet at the time and she had no idea what to do with it, but with very little help from me she figured it out through the tutorials provided. The screen isn't as large as I would've hoped but it does the job."
Polopoker,4,Great for the price,"Can't find a better tablet for the price, Apple should take a page from the Amazon book"
6.02E+26,4,"Works, but the battery wears faster.","Counting back, this is my 5th Kindle since they came out. I've never had to replace one that ""died"", but sometimes I want the newer features. This one is to replace the older ""books only"" unit that is starting to be un-cooperative that I take to work for reading during lunch. I'd have probably just gotten another ""reading only"" unit, like a paperwhite, but these were less expensive.Pluses, can carry movies, music, etc, like my Kindle HD Fire. Can easily let me shop on Amazon, can access free ""underground"" apps, (i really don't need it for games though), and it is simple to use.Minus, uses power quickly, like the Kindle Fire HD, I have to charge it daily to every other day. I set a password (VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), to prevent unauthorized uses or purchases. It has given me minor problems with books by marking that I was on a different page than where I stopped, and it ""links"" to the other Kindles and they go to that page as well. For some reason, accessories, like cases are more expensive. If you want to store a good deal more, you require an SD chip, ($11 for 32 GB)."
jlomanzo,4,Good,This was a good proce and does what it needs too for the price!
eahernandez1959,4,good entry level tablet,I bought this tablet because it was on sale and i had heard it was a good entry level tablet. It is quick on the touch response. Camera is decent but not the best. Its good to view videos.

maria,4,Excellent for a very low price,Fire is still a good tablet and a great tablet for the price.
Momof5,5,Nice Replacement,I got this kindle as a replacement for my daughter's other kindle whose screen was cracked but still functional. She loves it and she loves the OS. She doesn't really miss that it's not HD. I didn't get an SD card yet but since she has most things in the cloud it isn't really necessary at this point.

I am pleased to say that the lil' tablet is pretty easy to use and does lots of fun tricks, so to speak. Thank you lil' tablet for bringing me, painlessly, into the 21st. century! I would certainly recommend it to a beginner like myself and I don't think it is beneath the consideration of a tech saavier person."

Touch screen much better than the tab 4.
flyingjon4,4,It's a good item.,This item was bought as a gift and it did not disappoint the person whom I bought it for.
androb,5,Best budget tablet,For the price even without the Black Friday price of $35 this is a solid tablet. The new UI for Amazon tablets is much better and it runs smooth. Apps are butter and there is no lag in navigation of the home screen or between apps. I bought this for my little sisters ages 5 & 7 and my parents love the parental controls limiting play time on the tablet. The full experience comes only if you have Amazon prime which is also highly recommended

jahlion30,3,Budget Tablet,You can't go wrong for $50.00 The only thing is that the graphics and speed aren't the best.

loopylinda,4,Perfect for me,"I got this to replace a Sony reader--can't get books for it anymore. That's all I really wanted it for, but I have played around with it to go on-line or check e-mail. Pretty easy to use (but it comes with next to NO instructions). If anything, it comes preloaded with too much stuff. But they are all freebies, so I don't care. I like being able to adjust the type face size, turning the page with a flick of my finger and always coming back to where I am in my book if I put the system to sleep. It has a back lit screen, so I can read in bed or in the dark even without disturbing my husband. I'm very happy with it."

Scrappy,4,Good for the price,"It's great for kids at this price, not its not an iPad. Can only buy from kindle, so apps are somewhat limited. This edition added a SD slot to add storage!!"
FANUM,3,"Useless software, great hardware for the price","This is a competent tablet at a bargain price. Unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system. Amazon's take on Android essentially removes all functionality that makes Android great, to force you to use their services and apps INSTEAD of Google's.If you're a tinkerer or don't mind doing some software hacking, this is a pretty easy fix. You can hack Google's apps and services back into it, resulting in an amazing, and amazingly cheap Android tablet.Unless you're willing to do, or hire someone to do, those software modifications, you'll probably be disappointed. If you are, it'll be the best cheap tablet you'll ever own.It looks like it might be great for kids, even in its stock state. I don't have kids, so I could not test that. But I added a star for that possibility.Unmodified: 2 starsModified: 5 stars"
lioness,5,Great tablet for a great price..,Bought a 7' kindle on Black Friday for $34.00. What a great price for a great gift..

mcKno,5,Always an apple user,"First Amazon Fire tablet, previously had a first gen kindle, love this tablet and cannot beat the price $35!Working wonderfully -"
SmartShopper,5,Great tablet for the money,"The Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great tablet for the money (Got it during Black Friday for $35, but even at $50 is still a good deal). You can get most apps on the Amazon Underground store for free, and most add-ons for the apps are even free, compared to .99 cents each for apple devices. Only drawback for my preference, is that there isn't a facetime app to videochat with other Apple device users with. Other than that, pretty much any other iOS app is available for the Amazon Fire. Videos play very well, not HD quality, but not bad either. This is a great tablet for anyone looking for a portable device to browse the internet, check emails, facebook, etc, and for the price, it can't be matched by any other tablet on the market."
Teco1,5,Excellent entry level tablet,This Amazon Fire tablet is an excellent barebones tablet that is great for checking email and surfing ineternet keeping tabs on facebook and twitter! At 50 bucks ya can't go wrong!

soccman4,4,Great tablet for a kid,"It was the cheapest tablet, but still very useful considering it was for my toddler. Wanted something that I could play child shows from youtube and some learning games from apps. Wish there were more apps for him, but I'm sure with time Amazon will have a few more I'd like to see just as Apple does. When not in use, from time to time it works great for the needs I may have if I want a bigger screen than my iPhone or don't feel like booting up a laptop. The only downfall is that when it's locked, it displays ads for games. I found out this is due to keeping the price so low for the tablet."
JimW,5,Kindle Fire,"I like this tablet a lot. I now own 3 of them and feel good that I can have one close to the tv. If I step on it and crush it I am only out a few bucks. It is clearly not as nice as my ipad, but I can get 10 of these for what one I device costs. I use it to watch tv, read, and surf the web. As a sports fan, sometimes I line all three up so I can watch three games at once."

I prefer Samsung and the Google Playstore. Initial set up took a while citing the table to could not locate WIFI but it was on an accessible and in use by other devices at the same moment with accessibility for the Fire tablet to also connect. Eventually it connected but the ability to use the tablet, functions, tools, etc with ease was disappointing to myself (adult) and child I purchased it for.

tipsycamore,3,Lack of Google play store.,"Works great until....... I had forgotten that Amazon fire did not come with Google Playstore. I looked up how to add Playstore to the 7"" Fire. There are many videos on YouTube that showed how to add Playstore to the fire. All seemed to add it OK but the loss performance of the Fire was noticeable. There were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features. One example was Lifetime. It was slow to load and failed to bring up Chromecast. One reason I hoped for this app would work was my Samsung and Vizio SMART TV's don't offer this app. I found a old tablet I had forgotten I had. I loaded Lifetime and works perfect. I guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the Playstore, get a non Amazon tablet. It is just easier to use, apps should work and you don't have to fool around trying to adapt Playstore. If Playstore isn't critical, then I'm sure this a a great little table."

Roro311,4,Love my fire,This is my 2nd fire and I was so sad when it crashed. Love my new one but giving 4 stars bc the need to update the charger at the bottom. It sticks and you can easily break the inside I wish they would change that
Also,2,Give away,"Not much need for this thing, good price, but makes one wonder if they were on sale because they really don't do much and it would make a good gift for a youngster just getting started with a tablet. Not impressed at all."
Aloha808,5,Great tablet for a great price,"I bought this for my 13 yr old child for Christmas. She uses it to download and read books (saves lots of space on the book shelf) and she browses the internet, and watches Amazon prime movies. So far it has been a great device and for the price, it has been an amazing deal!"

Diana,4,Love this tablet,it was a good price and works well. I would recommend a case.
Poppa5ive,2,Not what we thought they were,"It is tough to use these tablets if you are use to Apple products. Internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the Amazon programs it is running. Everytime my kids play a game, the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory. I would not recommend these tablets for anything more that an e-book reader."
Mattp,3,Great for price.,"This is a fully functional tablet for under $1000. Yes it is slow, yes it works. For my child it is fine. If you are looking for something to be fast, slick, improve your productivity - you will need to spend more money."
AngelaC,4,Small but nice,"Nice for my hubby, he can watch Netflix and use it for the shows he watches."

AppleGuy,4,Perfect for the Amazon Junky,"If you are all in on Amazon, this is the tablet for you. If you don't care about all the bells and whistles, and don't need the latest and greatest tech its a great tablet. We purchased one for my dad (60+) and he enjoys it for his web surfing and facebooking. The screen could be bigger, but for the $30 bucks we paid for it, its hard to complain."
Mine,5,Excellent tablet,I bought 5 of these for the kids for Christmas Easy to set up Work perfectly
Rocko,5,Easy to use,Easy to set up and use. Great tablet for a non-techy!
chip44389,4,Great option to a book,"This is a good product for books only. The apps and other things are not like an iPad. Very clunky, slow......However, the kindle is better than an iPad for book reading. It is lighter, the interface with Amazon is seamless and you can say download a sample of 40 pages for free before deciding to buy it, which is a huge plus !!"
Kels,3,Good Tablet but has a flaw,Good tablet but it does not include google play like i was told it does by an associate in your store
NicoleR,4,Good for what we wanted it for,I bought three of these for my kids ages 7 to 14 and it works great for what they use them for. My only wish is that it came with Google Play Store but we were able to install that separately and works well.
Tbird81,4,"Amazon Fire 7"" table",I really like the tablet. It was easy to set up everything on it. The only complaint is that it is a bit slow. I love that I can add storage to it when needed.

melodicchaos,5,Excellent Tablet for 10 Year Old,I purchased this tablet based on price and the reviews for tablets in this price range. It has performed well for my child. I especially love the parental controls that are easy to setup and the ability to have multiple profiles on 1 device. I'm now thinking of buying one for myself to replace a stolen iPad.
Colosus,4,Nice Tablet,This tablet is great for reading. It is also very snappy from app to app.

Rickybobby1031,5,Works amazing,Love it working good no lag or anything best gift I have so far
thomasrg,3,OK Tablet,"The Fire Tablet has an Android operating system but is not like using an Android phone. Amazon's software makes the tablet more cumbersome to use and the tablet will often freeze. Also, you cannot download Apps from Google Play you have to get them from the Amazon App Store. There are several Apps from Amazon that you cannot remove even if you do not use them. Would not recommend without having Amazon Support."
Chels,5,Great tablet,"It's a great tablet for every day needs. Great for games, internet access and reading Kindle books."
James,5,Excellent,I would recommend the Kindle Fire as a great option for anyone who loves to read book after book. Well worth the price. Not so thrilled that a 2 year warranty was half the price of the item I purchased but that has nothing to do with the quality of the device.
Jamy,4,Good for Grandma,I bought this tablet for my senior citizen mother and it is easy for her to use.
SuperDad,4,Christmas Gifts,"I bought two, my 7 yr old loves it, my 13 yr old likes it. I think they are a great value for the price."

SKASMA,5,Great Tablet,"This is my 3rd Kindle, and we are very pleased with the ease of use and features Amazon has to offer. I suggested my brother get one for his kids and he too is happy. He actually uses it as much or more than his kids do. If you are looking to buy one, I suggest buying a case to help protect it from any bumps or bruises. I lost my 1st Gen Kindle because it was dropped without a case."
Lavender14,3,It is a good tablet,It is inexpensive tablet. The sound is not great too quiet.It is not the best but it is good price.

kaylahszoo,5,Gave this to a friend for Christmas. She loves it,I gave this Fire 7 tablet to a good friend for Christmas. All she had was a smart phone before and it is pretty small. She just loved the ease of setting it up and uses it all the time now. So much easier to navigate than her phone. Now she can lad books and read for a lot cheaper than buying them in the stores. She said she couldn't have received a better gift.
allthewayinSD,5,Great Tablet,Bought this tablet as a gift for my grandfather for Christmas and he loves it! Very user friendly! It's also lightweight and easy to travel with.
eynoj,5,Great value for the hardware,"Bought this tablet for a family member who isn't very tech-savvy. Wasn't terribly pleased to see how overflowing the OS is with Amazon ads and services, but I suppose that's how they keep the costs so low on an extremely affordable tablet. Look up how to download the Google Play Store on this tablet to get even more usage out of it. With that addition, it works great, and they love it."
Sandrak,5,Great for kids,Bought for son for Christmas very easy to use and durable
Plum,2,You get what you pay for.,Wanted a cheap tablet to read books and comics. I found the lack of apps to be disappointing. It seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy books from amazon or to buy apps.

Steve,4,Good product easy to use,Nice to just check emailAnd read books. I would recomend

Bill,5,Fantastic,I bought this one for myself. It works fine. It is fantastic.
mharrsch,5,"Small, light and a dynamite price!","As an owner of an iPad, I hesitated to consider the Amazon Fire Tablet as a supplemental device but my purchase of a network of Amazon Echo Dots and the Voice Cast capability with the Fire tablet was almost irresistable. So I bought one as a gift for my friend along with an Amazon Echo Dot to get her opinion of its value. My friend just raves about the Fire Tablet - especially the smaller, light-weight aspects of it. I know I would feel better toting around a small Fire tablet that costs only $40 instead of a $500 iPad so it looks like the next Fire tablet will be for me!"
CVS27,5,Great tablet for the price,"Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. Overall I like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting."
MannyP,4,Good tablet for the price,"Great beginners tablet, not too small but not that big either"
BRITTANY,4,"Simple, yet good.",Simple tablet with all the basics. Worth it for the price!
JoeZ,5,Good All-Around Tablet,This is a great all around tablet. This tablet is currently being used by my daughter and she loves it. It's a good size and the picture quality is good enough to watch cartoons and a few YouTube videos on. The best part is that it has a memory slot so you can save videos on it for travel.
sccrangel5,3,"It's ok, but nothing like an iPad",I bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trips or at appointments and she wasn't too fond of it. It's kinda slow and limited to what you can do. One feature I did like is that you can set a profile for kids and they'll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use.
etp83,3,kid friendly,"my kids get a lot of use out of their tablets. however, I wish the battery life was better."
Jordan,5,Great!,Awesome for the price! Highly recommended for anyone looking for tablet. Easy to use.

Jimg,4,Kids love it !!!,"This was recommended by a friend to give children something to do on trips, so I bought them for my grandchildren. They used it and were occupied and quiet all the way to DisneyWorld."
Moby1kenobi,5,Amazing for the price,I bought these for a road trip for my teen daughters. The ability to download amazon prime content for viewing offline was the hook for me. Video quality is adjustable with the download and looks great on this screen. Battery life is adequate and a non-issue with so many charging possibilities in cars these days. All apps that I have wanted have been available for it too.
SBro,5,I LOVE my tablet,I was skeptical of such a low price point tablet. My children broke a more expensive tablet that I owned and I needed a replacement. I absolutely love it.
Jorgieq,4,Good device,I use this while im at work to have a bigger screen to watch my shows on. However I prob dont really need it. It has most apps. Not all games thatbi use on my phone. Its big and nice screen. Resolution is very nive. However i hardly use it besides work. When I'm at home i iust use my phone. I gave it a 4* due to not having all apps or games available. The wifi signal doesnt pick up as well as my phone either.
Jman,3,Built Better than the Samsung Lite,Built solidly. Very slow. I bought this for my kids but I cant download kids YouTube on it

Marco,5,Great tablet for a great price,I was looking to buy a tablet mostly to connect to my speakers to play music. I found the perfect one for a great price.

Hookem30,4,Great for the price,"This is a great tablet for the price. Currently using it for 3 year old. Love the parent timers and settings. Only negative is with no physical button, going back or 'home' is little harder than other tablets. It isn't the fastest tablet either but works well if you use it for very basic needs"

Corinaesq,5,Great tablet for $50!,"The Fire tablet is great, especially for the price! And if you are an Amazon Prime member, it's even better. You can read books for free using Amazon's Lending Library and watch Prime videos for free too. You can even get Google Play Store and download apps (just Google it) on the Fire. Make sure you get a micro SD card right away, because the 8GB internal storage fills up very quickly."

Momma2NJ,3,Lacking memory,My 2 year old loves this thing. Uses it mostly for Netflix. Major issue with this is that it barely has any memory. It is very limited as to what and how much you can put on it.We have about 10 apps/games or less and Netflix app. It will not allow anything more as it has no space.

John007,2,It was average,Purchased for my kids but it was hard to navigate and ended up with purchasing an iPad
krenyats,4,Not as intuitive as I'd like.,"Overall, this is a far cry from the more popular iPad, and is nowhere near as intuitive or easy to use, but as a less expensive option for my children to learn on it is the perfect fit. The price point is perfect for first time tablet users, though you will surely need to invest in a memory card to expand the storage capacity."

Brighterdawn,4,My kids love them!,I really like this product. The kids can play all their games on it (even Minecraft) and they are really enjoying them. The one drawback was that it was hard to get them set up for each person with the parental controls. You really had to fiddle with it to figure that part out.

FilmVideoPost,4,sharp bright screen with limited apps,This tablet uses the Amazon version of the Android operating system. Not all apps and functions are available for use on this device. Tablet is reasonably fast and responsive. Screen is sharp and bright with a wide viewing angle. Speaker is minimal and lacks fidelity - external bluetooth speaker (not included) or hard wired audio system(not included) work well . Bluetooth works well. WiFi (N) works well. Both cameras are weak and grainy. Check to make sure the apps you want to use are available and also check to make sure they work well.
JDBB,5,"Best 7""/ 8"" Tablet","This is the best tablet in it's category at a price point which everyone can afford. Big thanks to Amazon for making this possible.

GoSilverSwords,3,Excellent for the price you pay,"This is definitely not an iPad or a high end tablet. Nevertheless, for the discounted price that i paid on it (so, less than $50), it is well worth getting. I wanted something bigger while waiting for the next iPad Air to come out, and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet. It is geared towards Amazon media consumption, ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than HD. If the sale comes back again where it is $15 off, I would not hesitate to recommend it again."

Gamermom,5,Awesome kindle,I have an older Kindle & this has so many more options. It has a camera & more apps.
AriKK40,3,Kindle Fire,"I was looking for a Kindle Fire because I have had other android tablets in the past and most times the Kindle app makes them crash or takes up too much space on the tablet. I like it for reading but it isn't as great for other things and you are not allowed to have the Google Play store on it because that competes with the Amazon app store. However, not all apps are available on the Amazon app store so this was an immediate drawback for me. I will keep this and use it but in the future I will not buy Kindle tablets again."
techmind,5,can't beat this deal!,"This is a great tablet for the money. I got it on black friday and am so glad I did get a few of them for the entire family. The biggest thing that sold me on this is that I am able to use parental controls and not worry about what my little kids are watching, reading, or playing. Go buy it for the family, you won't regret it!"
BrianG1287,5,Wife and kids love their Fires,"Bought this for my wife for Xmas. Also bought 3 more for each of my kids. Great interface, easy to use. Suggest buying a memory card as well for storage of all the apps."
Renny,4,Great!!,Great small tablet with great value!Must get one ASAP... You can't beat this price!!
justme,4,Perfect for my 12 year old!,She has no idea that this item has limitations and was thrilled to receive a tablet with a camera. She seems to be entrenched in it 24/7 so it must be working.
curly4president,5,SUPER FUNCTIONAL TABLET,"Great tablet, especially for the price. I didn't know exactly what I would use this for when first purchased, but have found many cool uses."
Cole,4,Nice tablet,The tablet works good for my son with the games he use
Smitty,5,Nice Tablet,I brought this for my nephew(6). He loves it does everything that the high dollar tablets do but at a fraction of the the cost. A very good buy!!!
LauraDoubleU,4,"Good, basic tablet","I got this on black Friday for $35. Even at the regular price of $50, it's a steal. It is a basic tablet that will download apps and go on the internet. While the internet browser isn't that great, it is comparable to a phone system, which costs a lot more."
orlando42,4,Great Gift,Would recommend it 100%. EASY TO USE GREAT FOR KIDS
Jessie,4,Great Tablet,First time I have ever used a Kindle Fire and I wasn't disappointed. It is very good tablet. The only downside is that there aren't that many apps like the Google store has.
HomeTheaterGuru,2,Too much advertisement,Every time it was turned on and Every time I went to the Internet I had advertisement. If I'm going to pay money for something I certainly don't want advertisement along with it. If it were free okay fine advertise to me.The advertisement could not be shut off. I returned it.
eemmak,5,Good Value,This tablet performs very well. It is great for someone that does not need a sophisticated tablet. Great value for the price.
Cl3an,2,"So,so","I purchased this for my husband to play his games on(clash of clans). The BB salesperson assured me he would be able to use it for that. Got it home, turns out you can only use/gets apps from the Amazon store which does not include games like clash of clans. It was already opened and set up so I gave it to my 6 yr old. He plays a few games on it and watches some movies, but would much rather play with the iPad."
Maya,5,great reader.,Easy to operate. Easy to download books. Size is great for carrying in a purse. Color is really good. Very happy with this product.
Cdennis,4,Great tablet for kids,"I purchased 3 of these, one for each of my children."
Hockeydad4,4,Nice tablet to supplement the iPhone,Bought 2 Fire tablets so my boys would not be starng at their iPhones for games. They were thrilled!
lauriethree,4,nice little tablet,"This Amazon fire tablet is a nice little tablet. Picture is sufficient for the price. Audio output is on back so if it's in a case, the sound is muted, but otherwise nice tablet for the price...."

rcbend21,5,Awesome Stocking Stuffers,We bought two of these for our kids and they both love them! Easy to set up and operate. They are a welcome improvement over them using their phones for all the apps and games they enjoy.

Becstar,5,Great present!,Daughter loves it and great customer service! Educational and fun!
sandy,5,Excellent Tablet for Basic usage,I was looking for a basic tablet for normal use - games and music - and this tablet answered my need and to top it up fit my budget as well. I bought this during the thanks-giving season this year and is worth the price I shelled out. Bestbuy as usual shipped it in time and free shipping was just an icing on the cake :-). Would recommend this to anyone.
Bouda,5,Love them,Order two and love them. Great gifts for anybody get cases for them
golfered12,4,Decent tablet,"This tablet is exacting what it is, an inexpensive, decent tablet. I got it for grandchildren to use for game apps and books from Amazon."
frugal75,5,Perfect Tablet for Beginner,I bought the fire for my father for Christmas. The is his first tablet and I was afraid he would not use it. He has not put it down and it could not be more user friendly! I would recommend to anyone looking for a low cost tablet!!!
Jamara,4,Good for its price,It really is helpful to have this tablet around. It's really good for its price but the camera isn't so good but it still is a great deal.
twilightvorkin,5,Kindle 7,Very convenient item to use. Easy to read ebooks and came with one month of Amazon Prime.
Maria,4,Quality product for the price.,"I bought this for my 9 year old and it is perfect for reading books and playing games. My only disappointment is with kindle because if I put him as I child under my account he has access to my books, which I do not want to happen. I had to create an account just for him."
Kindleuser1,3,You get what you pay for,Not as good as the HDX but does well for $50. Also much slower than HDX. Screen is more pixelated than anticipated. Would probably spend more next time and get a quicker unit.
Funny,5,Kindle,Nice device not bad on sale. You get what you pay for.
1234,4,Great,Very good item. Works well for child. easy to use.

Kteacher,5,Great price for classroom use,Bought for my K classroom!! Great price for student use!!
Blazemom,5,Love this tablet,"I hesitated initially when purchasing this tablet, mostly because I have never had a tablet or e-reader and wasn't sure I could figure out how to use it. Even though this table comes with virtually no instructions, there is a lot of information online and it is very intuitive, even for a total novice. Now, just about a month since my purchase, I am loving this tablet so much and am so happy I purchased it. The price break made it an even sweeter purchase."
Jmp825,4,Well worth the price,"This isn't a high performance tablet but i didn't expect it to be for the price. It's perfect for playing app games, reading, and web browsing. The biggest downfall is the limitations on customizing the home screens."
Liveforhim,5,Great Tablet,This was a replacement for a previous Fire. My wife loves it and the Fire does what she needs
Carolinny,5,10 ur old loves it!!!!,Love this kindle fire. Awesome product for an incredible price.

starango,5,Great tablet for kids,For the price this was a great tablet for my kids. They love it!!!
i3user,4,Solid tablet for the price,"Hard to beat, especially during Black Friday at $35. Meets the needs."
1reviewer,3,good tablet for the price,"This is a good tablet for the price, however, it runs slow and the touch screen response is not the best. This isn't the right tablet if you're looking for a high speed, high performance tablet."
TaraEG,5,Great for the price!,"I bought this as a requirement for my sons class. It was easy to set up, and he uses it with no problem at all. He just uses it for research in class, so I didn't want to spend a lot money-or give him my tablet, but I'm very pleased with all he's able to do on it. The price just seals the deal; I'm very pleased overall and would repurchase the tablet."
Stefpratt,3,Great tablet for a kid,I like what you get for the price. But it is a little tricky for my kids to figure out so I do have to help them a lot.
Joseph,5,Great Product for perfect Price,As good if not better than many other more expensive tablets
Techfreak,3,"Okay, not the best","This table works okay but slow. Warning, this device is ad subsidized for the price, meaning you have to see ads."
Kindle,5,Great Tablet,Easy to use economical and portable.I intially bought just for reading but it has been useful in apps facebook etc.
Gunderek,4,Great tablet,Realy good tablet for a great price can't go wrong
Zena63,4,Good for the price,"Nothing flashy. If you want something simple that you can just grab and go, use with babies/toddlers, throw around etc then this tablet is great. If you want something a little more robust save up for one of the more expensive models."
Jeanma,5,Great Tablet for young kids,"Bought this tablet for my little cousin and it fitted him perfectly. After 2 or 3 years, i might get him a bigger one."
Praiseguy,4,Can't beat what you get for the price.,I tried a few Samsung tables they were junk and I paid 4 times the price for those. this out preformed them 10 fold and was 1/4 of the cost. Still not quite an iPad but for the price there is probably nothing better. Free time for the kids is a great feature.
bjcarr21,5,Good Kindle for my 8 year old,My 8 year old is required to read for 20 minutes a day for school. Something about reading on an electronic device excites and he is willing to read without a fight. Great purchase for us.
SuzyQ,1,Frustrating to use,"I bought this for my 3 year old, so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my iPad. Needless to say, she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the Netflix app, and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem. You really do get what you pay for. If you buy this, don't count on getting online very seamlessly. The Internet browser is really slow to use, but you can get around this by downloading Google Play store to access the Firefox app, which is not offered on the Amazon App Store. Check YouTube for instructions.."
Mike,4,For so few dollars a great tablet,"I bought 3 of these for my kids. the parental controls are good, lacking in some areas but overall what I was looking for. a way to limit what they can do and I control what is on the tablet not them. and I can see their web history etc."
Nate,4,Good tablet,Bought this tablet for my grandson and he loves it.
Shez,4,Great tablet for kids,I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter and she loves it! This is a great and inexpensive item for a young child.
Andrea,5,Great kindles for my kids,My kids are loving their kindles and they are easy for them and for me to manage
GmaLaLa,2,Does not work with WowWee MiP app,"We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee ""compatibility"" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them."
TMRMOM,5,Great Tablet,"I purchased this table for my son to check email, watch movies and play games. He loves it!"
BBShopper,4,"Good deal for price, but still entry level",Nice tablet for beginner or casual user. Basic functions.
JGold7,5,Love this tablet!,"You can't beat a tablet at this price! I bought it mostly for reading books on the go on the Kindle app, but I've also been using it for so much more. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy an extra device at a low price."
computer,4,Great price for kids use,"This is a great item to use with kids. I like adding memory as needed. I love the kindle fire aspects....some items can be read by text to speech.I think the kids will like the camera, their old kindle fires did not have this."

Sassy,5,Love this fire,Glad I decide to purchase it on black Friday . You can do anything on it.
chadn1,4,Nice Small Profile Tablet/Reader,This is a great light weight android tablet. It works well for most things that I wanted to use it for. I wanted to see if it would work for board packets but decided that the form factor is too small. As a reader and light weight table it works great. At this price it is a great buy.
bargainhunter,4,Value for money,It's the best tablet $50 can buy. touch screen is better then my first gen nexus 7.
clhenson28,5,great product,Love this tablet bought 4 for my kids and myself and play games and read on these!
kcco85,4,great for kids when on the go,"This tablet has been perfect for my son. I actually bought 3 and my kids love it. The amazon app store has tons of free games for kids (panda, toca, etc.) my kids are 4, 5 and 10. In my opinion best cheap tablet for a family on the go. Screen is good for kids, seen no lag in performance also. Not sure about camera they never use it."
Jake,5,great tablet,"Tablet easy to use and is great for face book, internet, watching movies, and reading. price was great."
Eight,5,AWESOME,Got this tablet for a great price. Works well and has a fast processor.
Kindatechsaavy,4,Great item for affordable price.,"Amazon had the item sold out so I went to best buy to purchase and they had plenty in Stock, in store, which was great."
BigFlex,4,Can't beat the price,Obviously talking about a budget tablet here so you obviously get what you pay for as always BUT this is a really decent tablet for $35 bucks (what i paid on black friday). does all your basic 'tabby' things and is very mobile. Great for those kids who feel the need for a tablet but you dont wanna break the bank haha.
batman1984,5,great for price,"you get what you pay for, great little device for very cheap. this would have been a high end tablet a few years ago. to get one for sub 100 and not have it be a p.o.s. tablet from some no name branch is amazing. i use it as an ereader, for games, for second screen when watching movies or playing xbox, etc. great battery, included ads are unobtrusive, really only notice them when they appear on unlock screen or when it makes book recommendations. none of which i mind to save fifteen bucks on the unit. highly recommend. if you lose it or it breaks you barely spent anything on it and just get another one. the microsd support is really nice too"
Eytan,4,great compact tablet,"have purchased 4-5 tablets in my life, always Samsung or Apple, my first experience with an Amazon tablet, very happy with my purchase"
amazonfire,4,A good backup tablet.,"This tablet was good enough for reading, check email and watch some movies on internet. It doesn't has a lot of option for free app as Samsung or Apple devices."
amay23,4,Great value,"Definitely not the largest or most-powerful tablet you can find, but it made an excellent gift for my tech-fearing mom! Facebook, email, reading, web browsing and maybe some Netflix; that's the limit of what she does online and this tablet fits the bill."

Peanut2,4,Great product to use as a tablet,My son uses this to take notes in class and read material related to class. It has helped him by not having to take along extra books to class.

westhillsca,5,Can't beat the price,This tablet does everything and it's so much cheaper than an iPad. I don't know why people spend so much for an Apple when you get everything here for a fraction of the cost.

Branster88,5,Amazing,"Amazon's know for there tablets. Mine works great, good wifi and memory. I love the quad-core processor, great screen, crisp and clear.Comfortable and easy to use. 10/10"
mazdaboi,4,"Nice tablet, great features.","Picked this up for a spare tablet, and at $49 it was a no brainer. Videos, games, books, music work great. lots of capabilities. Screen looks great and it does feel a lot sturdier as it was a more expensive tablet. if you can't find an app, you can install Google Play store (have to search for it online for instructions). I did return this tablet as we specifically bought this to be use while on the treadmill, and you can't access Bravo or E! Tv. They only make apps for iOS (iPad/iPod/iPhone) other than that...its not a problem with Amazon or their tablet, I blame it on Bravo.Excellent tablet otherwise.. I will definitely buy it again in the future. Just don't need it at this moment."
Apple,5,love,LOOOOVVVVVEEEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jayfer,5,Great tablet for the money.,"Love the idea that this tablet is expandable to 128GB. The Ipad Mini 2 that I also have does not compare even close to this tablet, as it is not expandable beyond its 16GB. Overall, just an outstanding tablet."
Alex,4,Very good for the prize,This tablet is for my mom who only knows the basics of technology. You can play games on it and social networks easily. Anything more advanced I wouldn't recommend. Great product starter tablet for am amazing price.

Nannie,5,Daughter had one a long time ago. She loved it.,"I bought 2 of these and they were both Christmas gifts (1) for my daughter and (1) for her daughter. The price was great ! Now, how do I let you know who the owners are and how they can set them up in their names?"
HartP15,4,Great value for price,"Overall for the price you can't really complain, yes it has directed advertisements on the start screen when you turn it on but again, $50 for a tablet isn't that bad and the ads can be removed by subscribing to Amazon Prime which offers features in itself too."
Jayg,5,Best tab on the price,"Excellent just 50$ , and has all the features and a vast collection of books"
Isaac,3,Too Many Adds,I actually ended up returning this item because I got frustrated with the adds. If it wasn't for that I probably would have given it 5 stars.
Nitkur,4,Easy to use for day to day browsing,Easy to use for daily usage . Small and can be hold using one hand . Very good option for kid .
value1,5,Incredible number of features for the price.,"Bought the original Kindle Fire, and was impressed with the latest updated version. Better software, camera, and more apps make this all the more worth the small price. I guess that Amazon takes a loss on the production of this unit to gain your interest in buying their merchandise and using their services. In any case, it works, and I would recommend this to anyone interested in an inexpensive internet access device."
Chris,4,good,"Bought for kids to play games on, good for what they need it."
aspekt,5,Vry helpful foe anyone,This tablet has all apps needed for anyone. only one things not working with this tablet - this is some apps GPS.

Cnote252,4,Good picture,Would buy again good resolution. Wish the screen was bigger
itango1966,4,Kindle Fire $49.99 version,Bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Tab that was about 3 years old and seemed to be running slow and was a bit heavy for a 7inch tablet. This is much lighter and since I will probably use it mostly to read books and play games like candy crush it is fast and easy to use. Very happy with it so far.
Greedo,5,good tablet,Easy to use. Good first tablet. Would highly recommend.
Gopher1,4,Great tablet for the money.,My Google Nexus suddenly died with 5 blinks of death so I got this for temporary tablet. Nice to have micro SD slot. Can't find some of my needed apps yet like my BANK. Maybe it's me.It has Single speaker but if I want nice sound I'll use headphones.Maybe a touch dimmer than the Nexus.It fits my old Bluetooth keyboard so I'm good.
Rich,3,Frustration++++,"The sales rep told me this kindle Fire tablet is easy to set up. Just follow the directions. Three hours later + a trip back to the store, a member of the Geek Squad finally got my e mail to work. He could not tell me why it was a problem. Also the camera quality is very poor. If you use it to check your e mails and browse the web, its fine. Other than that.... oh well."
Neha,5,Great buy,Awesome gift for the price... Small enough tobe carried around everywhere..

The product was well priced, as well as having great features. I couldn't have brought a better Christmas present for them. I allowed them to customize and wrap their Amazon Fires.

Grandma05,5,Great tablet.,"Could not beat the price and the kindle fire is a nice tablet to have for reading, playing games, letting grandkids play on."
Krunchtroll,4,Great tablet overall,"First, let me say, that I only took one star away, because even after getting I touch installed, my little girl can turn the unit off or mess with whatever is playing by pushing buttons. Not sure if it would have been worth it to pay the extra fifty for the kids edition. Aside from that one single item, this has been an excellent purchase."
RonaldoPeppers,4,Great Price / Great Gift,Great for a good read or binge watching in your bedroom. Slim size tablet so it fits perfectly in your palm

tatted316,4,Nice little tablet,My daughter loves this tablet. It's not as big and flashy as some but it has all the bells and whistles needed.
neanderthal,4,Good but not the best,The tablet is great for only $50 but certainly not the most touch responsive. It feels a little slow to me. It also irked me that you have to pay extra to remove the ads from the lock screen.
garym,5,great player for a teen,Would recommend for anyone great value big screen great features
Drew,5,nice product,just getting this kindle figured out. so far I like what I see.
Arle12,5,Great value,My first tablet purchase & is perfect for my needs. Very easy to operate.
lalo,3,ordinary. It's the only thing I can say about this,"the screen is mediocre. the processor is good, very little storage. and you have to deal with ads, every time you turn on the screen. You can pay to have them removed. for that price you can get a better screen, more storage and open ecocistem. that is not tied only to amazon"
Parent,4,Great for the price,Bought two of these for the kids so they would not fight and could each have their own. They love them so far. I like that I can add an SD card for extra storage.
cathy,5,great tablet,Great black Friday deal. Love the tablets. Recommended
Warren,5,excellent value for a minimal price,Using the tablet on a daily basisEasy to use especially for reading msgs and news items.
elvisgumpster,5,Nifty ereader,"I bought this to replace my Nook reader, $50 for a Fire vs $140 for a new Nook was a no brainer. I had to use Calibre to convert some epub books to mobile format on the Fire, but that was easy. The ability to use WiFi to check email, surf the web, it's miles ahead of the black and white Nook."
Lauren,5,Great value,This is a awsome tablet and a great value love it!
Dancekidsmom,5,Great budget tablet,"This tablet offers amazing value for the price. It is not hd but still offers good resolution. Reminds me of the graphics on the first iPad or iPad mini 1. Performance is right up there with the more expensive models. With the ability to add more storage with an SD card, and Amazon customer service, you really can't go wrong with this one."
jailene,5,amazon tablet,This is a really good tablat at a good price.. my sister bought one naby tablet from another store at $200 and is not even working she has troble to charge the naby tablet for that reason i gave her the amazon tablet is not expensive and also has good feautures.
AzArtist,5,Great for the price,I ordered two for my grandchildren for Christmas and decided to get one for me on the black Friday deal because I couldn't beat the price. I've been using it for about 1 week and so far I am really liking it and my grandkids will love it. They only issue I've had is the 3rd day I couldn't get it to charge so had to do a hard restart but now the charger cord that came with it no longer works but its too short anyway so I use a micro usb cord I had. I've read that this is an issue with these but who doesn't have an extra micro usb cord laying around.
bubblebee,5,Affordable Durable Effective Table,"The tablet is very durable, and it also contains sufficient applications. Good quality."
Willow,5,Great starter tablet,I brought this tablet for my 5 year old nephew. For 50.00 He can stay off mine and enjoy Netflix and you tube. Plus it has parental control. Greatest gift ever!
Amos,5,great item,This is great for a first time tablet owner lots of features
Boss,5,Great tablet,Got this tablet for my daughter and she loved it again great tablet.
Nope,2,Maybe if you like to read digital books,Decent product. Not so much if you're used to android software. You can't get your photos saved in google. More than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted. Basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor. Exchanged it for am android tablet
linda,4,Great tablet for watching movies,"Would be better if you could use the Google play store, still haven t figured out how to download yet"
Pete,5,Does the job.,"My wife's laptop bit the dust and I needed a low-cost solution so she could read her email and surf the net. This device does the job. I was impressed with the quality for $50. I have no complaints. Cheap, easy to use and keeps the wife happy. Good deal!"
DougtheGreat,5,This is a lot for the money Look at what it can do,"Before you conclude it does not have enough, look at what it can do and read the specs."
iAmberkinz,5,A Gift,I Bought This For My Five Year Sister. It's Easy To Use & She Loves It. She Had A Nabi Before But The Charger Port Wasn't Suited For A Young Child It Was Easy To Break. This Tablet Is Ten Times Better All Around.
rewardjunkie,4,Great starter tablet,"Bought for a Christmas present for family member, great value."
teacher22,5,Could Not Ask for More,"I've avoided an e-reader as my tablet served well. When Amazon released this new Kindle Fire for $50, I thought, why not? I'm traveling a lot and it's nice and compact.Whoa! It also doubles as a tablet, as far as being able to access Internet, email, other things; the Amazon app (I can't remember the name, but it's pre-installed) has hundreds of free--yes, free--apps.I'm delighted to the point I've now purchased two more as gifts. I did add an SD card to increase storage space, but that was minor. Great product; excellent buy!"
patp,5,Amazon Fire Tablet-7 A GREAT DEAL,I have two Apple I-Pads that my students and I use in my third grade classroom. I've wanted one for home use but didn't want the expense. This Amazon Fire tablet does just about as much as my school Apple I pads but at less than a quarter of the cost. The amazon fire tablets are smaller but easy to use and amazingly fast loading! wish i had one for each student!
Godsgirl,4,Granddaughter loves it,We're really enjoying it. The price was right. Great 4 a beginner
Meatball,4,Nice price for useful item,Can't really tell you much as I gave it as a gift but it has been well received.
Honey,5,I love these tablets,I bought three of these tablets. They are the best tablets around. They are very fast and durable as well. They are simple to use both of my children use them. I haven't had any issues with this product.
Nahid,4,cool item for price,It was on sale. Worth it for a first time tablet buyer for something inexpensive
Dave,5,Great item for the money,"Pretty good tablet for the cost, I would highly recommend!"
fred2412,4,great tablet for the price,"a great tablet for the price, i love now that the amazon fire tablet has a micro sd slot. lightweight, connect to net easy,"
SAINTETHAN,5,BEST VALUE,For the money this tablet can't be beat. great for kids or adults who aren't looking for a powerful tablet.
Gothamite,2,"As they say, you get what you pay for","Pros:InexpensiveExpandable storageGood for Amazon Prime members and Amazon shoppersCons:Slow/sluggish performanceLack of apps (no YouTube, Instagram etc)Some available apps crash or can not be installedTouch screen freezesScreen resolution is not sharp or bright, greenish hueToo many links/ads to buy thingsSound quality is not goodWiFi onlyConclusion:For the price the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet is good for those who want an eReader that can also access email, Facebook and Amazon Prime but the lack of apps, cheap construction and buggy performance keep it from being a good, full-featured tablet."
ima80zkid,5,Perfect Gift,I love this. It is great. One of the best things I ever bought. It can do so much.
Samantha,3,Good price,"You cannot beat the price on this tablet, but there is no bluetooth. Also, it really hits you hard with advertising and trying to get you to do everything through amazon. We bought it to use in the kitchen with our digital cookbooks."
Applehatersux,4,Good entry level tablet!,"I read mixed reviews on these tablets and nearly talked myself out of buying one, but then on Black Friday the price hit 35 bucks temporarily, so I bought it.I am really happy that I did.While it's no where near that of the Apple devices in overall image quality, it puts out a pretty nice screen view with plenty of color and brightness.I was able to download all the main social media apps, several streaming content apps, and plenty of games to mess around with all for free. So far only 1 app has ""crashed"" on me resulting in a restart.The size is perfect, almost fits in a man's jeans back pocket without a case, but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended periods.Battery seems to hold up well, and the buttons are working as they should, with quick transitions and processing.I added a 64GB SD card to store things later, but I never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device.The camera works well.The sound is decent.They make cases just like that of the Apple tablets for as little as 8 bucks.Bottom line, it's not the best tablet, but it is a good one for someone who's never used one or just wants one for general purpose use. I would trust a device from Amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablets.We bought 4 more to give away at Christmas we liked ours so much."
itsamemario,4,Easy setup,Great and easy setup. Easy to use for people that don't have much tech experience
Reviewer,5,Good price for ereader,"Got this for a present for someone, and they love it. They really wanted an e reader not a tablet and that's why he loves it."
Alex,5,Nifty,"Awesome little tablet. It isn't the fastest, but it gets the job done. Bought one for my father and one for myself. He uses it to watch DIY videos on YouTube and online browsing. I do the same and also listen to my Spotify playlists. It's pretty cheap too!"
Vbaxley1976,5,awesome,we love this tablet and the price. awesome deal. it was so good we going back to get two more. it's amazing .. can't say no more except get you one
Faye0112,3,Does not connect to tv,"I bought this tablet to connect to my hdtv. After not being able to get it to connect, I called Amazon customer care who informed me that this model doesn't connect to the tv, but the previous model (4th generation) does and that I should purchase the Amazon fire stick. Why the newer model does less...who knows. If you want to watch movies just on the tablet then it's a great buy, but didn't work for my purposes."
whateverDAN,5,great value,"not top of the line but don't let the price fool you. If you don't already have a tablet and not looking to spend a lot this is perfect. Plenty of free apps and games. You get the most for your dollar on this product, makes a great gift for friends and family."
Toni1234,5,Great,"I love it , this was a great investment for my family"
EagleFan,3,Too small,"My mother has the larger Amazon tablet, which prompted me to purchase this version. The tablet screen seemed smaller than a standard 7' tablet, so I returned it."
chinnakn,5,Excellent product for the price,"I bought this item for my kid for 35$ and enjoying lot. Compared to other Tabs this is a great bargain.Pros: Its easy to use , battery is excellent works for long, even while games are being played.Strong body and very good touch sensitive.Cons: Screen resolution looks little grayish , not bright enough. which probably is good for kid eyes while playing longer."
jordan,4,Kindle,"Small tablet, I have an Ipad but this item is great to take along fits in your purse and is very durable. I have purchased 3 other for family."
vincent,5,very good,so beautiful and system is very good and the app is good too.
Jayap,5,Great Tablet for Time pass,Its worth to buy this table for the price. elegant design and response. feel better than samsung tab
stl314bestbuybuyer,5,got for my 4 year old,Got for a 4 year old solely for games has enough memory for kid apps
Niceone4you,2,Awesome for avid book readers,"The resolution on the games is not good. I didn't even try to watch Netflix because i knew it wouldn't show clearly. Also, it is slow using the internet. I assumed it would look and work like Android but i wrong. Everything is Amazon which i am unfamiliar with. Honestly, it is better for reading books. I returned for something more diverse and better."
jwesley88,4,What a deal,Was a nice deal for 50 bucks can't beat that and its fast and works great
JohnnyNC,3,"Works great, just small","This tablet does what it supposed to do, however, if you have one of the newer smart phones with a large screen there just isn't enough difference in the screen size to justify a second piece of equipment."
Melly,5,Great,Great kindle for the price nice picture for a 7 inch screen
DJ4rmHouston,5,Great device,"I bought my wife one, she bought me one a few weeks later and now I'm going to buy my mamma one. Great on the go, take to work and business trip device. My little girl loves learning on the kids ABC and coloring app!"
Ca008,5,Worth for the price,"It is an amazing product for beggnners, high quality materIals amd fast processor"
Pm5k,4,Cheap and great for first timers,50 bucks and It's still a good tablet . I have issues with it cause I've always used the iPad so it's a completely different experience .I just wanted something to watch movies while I rode the train and this is perfect . The biggest flaw is the ads everytime you turn it on but makes up with the capability of adding storage . Look 50 bucks for a good tablet is cheaper than a night out with friends
Sassy,5,Great Little Tablet,"I purchased this tablet for my mother for the camera, reading books, and emailing. Awesome price and value!"
AdamJames,5,Small and fast,The unit seems to have a sturdy build and it loads and unloads very quickly
Leah,5,Great tablet for my daughter,I thought $49 for a Kindle tablet was a fantastic price until the Black Friday deal of $35. I did add a 32gb memory card. Kindle Freetime is great. My 6 year old loves the tablet. Works great with many kid friendly apps. I also put a kid proof cover.
fisherman,4,It fits my needs,"I had an old kindle, and its battery was beginning to fail. The Kindle Fire 7 replaces it, with much more functionality. It does, however, require charging more often."
TERRY,3,OK TABLET MAJOR SHORTFALL,restricts use of some web pages- including barnes and nobles where I have a library- useless to read the books in my Barnes library
LeviathanMN,4,Got a Great Deal!,For the little price I paid this was a good buy for the kids. I prefer the Amazon tablets for my kids so they can be more involved with reading.
Emanuel60,5,Great e reader,Great to read books and it do almost everything a table will do
scubasteve,4,great for the money,Don't expect top of the line performance from this 50 dollar unit but it has really nice picture ok sound and good battery life. Shortcomings would be small memory causing laggy performance at times unless you keep your storage amount low on the built in memory.
jack1230,5,Very good quality,I bought about 5 tablets before. This is the best tablets I ever bought.
MnShopper,4,Great deal for the price,Only reason I was not able to rate this five of five is that the app 3m cloud library is not yet compatible so getting books from the library requires an older app which does not work as well.
abe192,5,Nice tablet,A really nice tablet for a first time owner. Works great and has a decent sized screen
Sjgigi4,5,Love it!,I had a tablet that was stolen and I was happy to replace it with this one it is just as nice and easy to use!
JerryUSA,5,Fire Tablet,Works great with a prime account. Get 1 free book per month. only problem is if you have 2 tablets you both have to share the same book. Works great with my local library..(Remember those?)
beavece39,4,small tablet,"For me it is too small. I would prefer it to be 8""."
Spider,5,Great Tablet for the price,I originally bought this tablet for my granddaughters birthday gift. When I saw how easy it was for her to access her homework and other reading materials she needed for school I was so impressed I bought 5 more for each one of my grand kids for Christmas I would recommend this tablet to family & friends.
Migg,5,LIghtweight and portable,"Great product easy to use and scroll, better than a competitor product we purchased"

ZimmBobb,5,Super Buy,Love the Kindle Fire. Was a previous Nook user. This is so much better and am so much more happier with it.
spsp,3,"OK, not great","My old Kindle Fire got pushed into the water by my cat, so I bought a new one. It's OK, but nothing to write home about. Kinda of slow and the size is a little awkward.....too narrow. It'll do, and the price is right, but if you can afford more, buy a better tablet."
Reader,5,Great product! Great price!,I have been wanting to get a Kindle for my children and happened to see this at Best Buy. Couldn't pass up a fantastic Kindle at a great price.
afasoxman,5,More than entry level tablet,"This tablet is excellent. Hard to imagine all these features can be in this unit for under $50.00...It is a must buy, especially if you have children who like to use your tablet. Perhaps buy them one of their own....For us it is one of a few tablets we own, but it is one we are glad to have."

mdquispe,4,"Love it, it does the job for me.",It does the job for me. Its small and portable. Keep it in air plane mode with the wifi for longer battery life.
Jenni25,3,Cant expect a lot,The tablet works only when it wants too. I have to restart it all the time for it to work properly. Only have 2 weeks with it and the youtube app sucks it doesn't work properly
EH08stud,5,For the price you can't go wrong.,So what they have adds. My wife got it for $50 and I know on Black Friday it was $35. Where else are you going to find a color screen for that price. It works well and couldn't be happier.
corirell,4,Good tablet for price,I gave this to my 3 yr old to play games and watch movies. My TV's have been reclaimed!
rad123,5,great tablet,for an inexpensive tablet it works great. does the basics very well.
wclewis12,4,Pretty neat,"Think of it as a solid, but generic iPad. It's not as impressive as what Apple does, but it's respectable. Purchased for a friend and he's loving it."
tyler,5,nice advance in the kindle line,enjoy all the upgrades. would suggest it to others
Mindymom,5,Best Kindle Ever!,"I love, love, love this Kindle Fire 7. I Like the size, the quality and most especially, the price. This product greatly exceeded my expectations. I use it every day. I recommend this Kindle Fire 7 to anyone who is thinking of buying a Kindle Fire. I am telling all of my friends about it!"
Pappy,5,Great buy,"This has to be one of the best deals around - The screen resolution is good, the speed is adequate and it is versatile as a reader, game device or internet tablet."
Tiefighter,5,Great Value,"Bought as replacement for Kindle HD 7 2012 model. Works great, considering the price. The expandable storage is awesome!"
maze,4,good for kids,got it for my son to replace his old one and for the kids free time app good so far
Joitalian,4,Good,It's a very good one for my children to play with so
RowMan,5,You won't find a better tablet at this price!,"Sure. It's not an iPad, but it's only 50 bucks! Amazon is taking a loss on these in order to sell you their content. There are a few restrictions, like an advertisement on the lock screen and only access to Amazon's App store. These are small prices to pay for such a wonderfully performing tablet. Also, Amazon Underground gives you access to a ton of paid apps for FREE. If this is your first tablet purchase, it is definitely a winner. For those not new to the tablet world, it is definitely worth having just to carry around when you need it. You won't feel so bad if someone steals it or you lose/break it as opposed to an iPad. Just buy it already!"
HETAL,5,great for kids,Last year I bought other tablet and this year this one it is really a better then any other brand.
Nick,5,great price,"Was a great deal for my daughter for Christmas, her last one broke."
kbstylez1826,5,Great product for its price,The Amazon Fire is a very good tablet that is very user friendly and the price is great.
Velma,5,The Fire 7 is awesome!,I haven't found anything I don't like about this! It is just what I was looking for!
redsoxlovr,5,A great tablet for a great price,"I had always wanted a fire tablet and when this deal came along I couldn't pass it up! Great tablet and well worth the price! Lots of apps to choose from, easy to set up and use!!! I highly recommend this tablet for anyone!"
2Happy,4,"Good, low cost, entry level tablet","Seems to be relatively user friendly but as a new tablet owner, I would have appreciated having some basic instructions come with it rather than have to learn everything by trial and error. I'm sure I still do not understand many of the capabilities this tablet has to offer."
Candy,5,Love it,"I brought 3 for my boys and they love it. My three year old watch mickey mouse, my 9 year ol surf the web for homework and my 15 year old use it for you tube and music even live chat with his friends."
alvin51,4,Great tablet for the price,This tablet does everything the Ipad Mini can do except that it is cheaper than the Ipad.
agc2810,4,Budget Tab,"For the price, it's hard to beat. Don't go into this thinking it is like any other Android tab. In many ways it is, and the ability to sideload apps helps. But this is primarily a vehicle to get you into the Amazon ecosystem. Not necessarily bad, but those expecting full access to Google will be disappointed.What it is good for:Web surfingNewsreaderAudio playerNetflix, Hulu, etcWhat's not so great:No GPS, location enabled but not true GPSScreen Resolution, angles and clarity are good but given the price, it can be forgiven"
Samantha,5,Great tablet,Bought it for a child. He works it very easily. Would recommend

Chico,4,A remarkable item,"I purchased this tablet about a month ago, have enjoyed it every since! I would truthfully say it is one of the best."
NavinRJohnson,4,Decent tablet for the money,"For the price, it's a decent tablet. They way they get the price down is to psuh ads to your device. You can pay $15 to get the ads removed. Overall it's a good tablet."
Lavonne,4,Like my first Kindle better,Enjoy Kindle but have to tap screen several times before it goes to next screen when I'm in e-mail
bigguy,4,Very good tablet for the money.,Very useable device for the low cost. The screen is very bright and easy to read.

Grandma,5,Great for my grandson,This is my grandson first tablet. He is thoroughly enjoying it.
Tristyle,3,Good Tablet for reader,The tablet is great for reading. It does not allow you to download many of the games my child enjoys which are usually available on other tablets.
happienswt,5,Awesome product,Great item for the price. Reliable and works great.
Marvinthinx,5,Great for accessing amazon content,"I got what I paid for. At this price point, there is no arguing that this is value for money. Great for accessing amazon content though my toddler finds it great streaming videos as well."
5454,5,Great tablet for the price,"This tablet is great at what it does:Netflix, Amazon, and general Internet searches. It obviously does other things and for the price it's fantastic."
44zionhouse,4,Light weight,It's a great tablet for the price. .I love the idea of shopping from my tablet.
LeiaSolo1,5,Very nice Kindle device for the price,I really like this Kindle. It has more features than the Kindle Fire 6. And the processor is a little bit faster as well. It is great for reading for the price and it is very economical as well.
melpat56,5,Fantastic!,This is a fantastic pad for anyone my absolute favorite sturdy access so easy and I will always give it 5 stars!
New2this123456,5,Good for a price,I bought this for my girlfriendAnd she loves it. The only thing she doesn't like is that some games on the app market that is on her phone doesn't appear on her tablet
Mike,5,great buy,"The Fire tablet does everything I need it to do. Bought this as a gift for my 10 year old and he couldn't be happier. He can download all his games and apps, I like the parental controls on it."
MickyP,4,"Fantastic for the price, but ok for the competitio","I was originally just looking for a cheap but reliable tablet, on a post-birthday afternoon, when I learned Amazon was selling a low budget version of the current Kindle generation.While my opinion is slightly biased due to some personal modifications, I can say this is an excellent purchase if you're looking for a portable browser and book reader. A fairly decent and accurate battery. Sound is low in volume but reliable. Expandable memory works for applications, so dozens of apps can be added quickly. While I can personally say it's extremely durable compared to iOS devices. A small fall against smooth stone does not cost anything but extremely fine scratches only visible in sunlight.However, by default, you're extremely restricted by the Amazon marketplace, which is nowhere near as updated and expansive as Google play. If this could access both stores, I'd give it a 5 out of 5."
Kissy,5,Awesome Tablet,If you are a Amazon Prime member you will love this tablet. Even without Prime membership its still a nice tablet.
Blues27,5,Loved it great price,"Bought this for my brother who is a Dino when it comes to technology, it's easy to use and a great size ,he loved it!"
sophie2013,5,great tablet for the young,Great picture quality and very easy to operate. Got it for the granddaughter.
echorock,5,Great Tablet nice size,"I like this Tablet for it's size, it's easy to hold on to when reading. I can put this in my bag when travelling and it doesn't weigh much...I also love the fact that I can expand the memory, whereas the other one I have 8.9 inch doesn't have that capability...The Camera works great...The only problem I have is trying to turn it off it doesn't always want to turn off...other than that I love this Tablet..."
Chelly,5,I Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.,My 7 year old loves the tablet. It is very durable.
Berniemac,5,"Great buy for the money, a must buy for $49.99","I bought this tablet the kindle fire7 for my woman and she absolutely loves it, works flawless for all her needs,very well made, does not come across as a cheap tablet a absolute must buy for 49.99! Best $50 tablet on the market hands down better than some I spent much more money on and in fact should I need one myself currently have a insignia flex8 16gb I will buy one for me. Great tablet for kids as well for $50 and the reliability great buy!"
RycheBabe,4,Kindles are great,"What made this even better was the Black Friday prices on the Kindle Fires. At $35.00, if they get broken, it's not as big of a deal. I remember buying one of these when they came out and it was a whole lot more than it is now. That's technology for you, I guess. Great buy. Great product."
GoYankeesandJeter,4,Great for the price,A tablet for under $50. What a good deal. Thanks Amazon.
T313,3,Nice Tablet for the Price,"I recommend it mostly for reading, but it's ok as a tablet."
Dhughes,1,Broke,Bought it on thanksgiving night just opened pkg and the screen is crushed. Haven't been able to take it back but was told when I called in that they might not have any in stock.
tifnbil,4,great and convenient,handy size and works well for what it is. would be a 5 if google play store. (but it is available)
bigcoe,3,Great tablet for the price,"Cheap tablet for price, for a kid or an older person that might not know how to use it."
Carnage,4,Can't go wrong.,"First off the tablet is $50 so don't go in expecting it to be on par with the latest iPad. For the price you pay though, you get a really good tablet. Screen is a little lower than 720p, but you have access to all of the Kindle books, Amazon Prime, the new Fire OS, which looks alot better than the ""all black"" on the last few Kindle Fire's. This model is only 8gb but storage is expandable, I have a 64gb Micro SD in my tablet. Recommended."
csell52,4,Great for Kids,Bought this mainly for my grandkids to play. The time limits you can set is great because they don't argue about who's on the most.
thenight11000,4,great budget tablet,great and easy to use budget tablet for 35 when I purchased it. Get one
Mamland,1,I don't recommend it.,"This 7"" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. It's like a very ""dumbed"" down, cheap version of the better FireHD and HDX. Screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to TV and it's slooowww as can be. If you've never owned another kind of Kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one. I got mine on Black Friday for a little over $30. total with shopping discounts and I'm still sending it back! That's how disappointed I am with it."
xxxx,5,Perfect Tablet,"Overall, this tablet is great for kids and adults. It's not overpriced and you can do a lot with it. Including, browsing the web, downloading paid or free apps, downloading books free or paid, listening to music, shopping right through amazon, storing files, and plenty more. I wouldn't trade this tablet for any other."
RobQ,5,Great tablet,"Worth getting, great for the priceAnd very handy for movies and music"
Mrsgibson,1,Great for books that's about it!,Was not a fan of this product Browsers are extremely slow
Dkatylady,3,Works well,I have an IPad but thought I would buy this Black Friday to play around with and program to give to my Mother to enjoy.
ThatGamerGuy,4,Great entry tablet,This is a very good starter tablet for anyone wanting to mess with one without breaking the bank. Everything runs and looks great from videos to games to books. Only thing that I feel could push people away is the app store(uses Amazon's). Otherwise this is great.
Betteronthepc,5,cheap tablet for the price!,"The tablet was on a great deal for black friday. I purchased it just for reading books and lightly going online. I am not expecting amazing power from something so cheap, I dig it for what it can do and not for what I think it should do."
techsavy,4,affordable and easy to carry,"I am happy that i purchased this tablet because it has become very useful when i do my studying and for social media. it is a cute size so it fits in my purse easily . The only reason i do not give it 5 stars is because it doesnt have the ability to add some apps such as chegg, snapchat and among others."
Thapa,5,Great kindle,I love this kindle and price is awesome .My Three year boy love to play it.
Polar,5,It's a huge deal,This is a must buy for anyone. It's sturdy and its a amazon for only fifty dollars. But the camera is not good for photography but its worth fifty dollars overall.
Ace420,5,Can't beat it for the price,"I got this on black Friday for $35. For the price I wasn't expecting much. Let me tell you it exceeded my expectations. I was only wanting this to play music, but I have been checking my email, browsing the web, using Bluetooth for music. Its amazing. It can go the whole day on one charge. You will defiantly want a SD card for it! It rarely lags and is pretty fast too. Only thing I don't like is the ads on lock screen (you can pay 15 more to remove them)"
AJ1983,2,Price is good but not worth !,"Bought this tablet this Thanksgiving for $35.Tablet is too slow and apps doesn't responds properly, tried doing the updates over wifi to see if that resolves the issue but that didn't work too.Commons apps like Gmail, Facebook, Messenger or browser related are dying very frequently and sometimes doesn't even boots up, also, coming from Android you will feel that you have landed up in a deserted apps land.A good tablet for kids but adults can't rely on it !"
Blackcherry,5,Excellent buy.,"I purchased this item for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to use, beautiful picture, and a great price."
liz12,4,Great tablet for kids,I bought it for a gift and I love the price. Also my nice is enjoying it
Rainstorm49,5,Great Tablet,I got this for my brother as an early Christmas gift. He has never owned a tablet before and not super tech savvy. He really enjoyed it and never put it down over the holiday weekend. It was easy for him to use and adapt to.
adesfanmail,4,Great price for what you get,"I like this device because it keeps my niece and nephew happy while on the road. For the price, it can't be beat. It's not as intuitive as it could be."
MarieNYC,5,So much device for such a low price,"I must say I have always been making jokes about Amazon and their devices, but after getting the Amazon Fire 7, I must admit I have been wrong. This little device is amazing for such a low price. You honestly get a lot for your money, and I can definitely recommend it to people who want a good tablet without spending $100+ on one."
Diab,5,Tablet,This works fine. It's a tablet! It does things well!
Flashcamera,5,A Great Little Tablet,"This is a great little tablet for the money and does nearly everything you would want to do with a tablet. I plan to use it for travel and leave my expensive iPad Air 2 home. I was impressed with the resolution when viewing photos and it works well for reading email and Internet surfing. It is also great to have adequate storage by adding a micro card to the unit. Probably the major drawback is the camera, which does not take a very good picture when compared to cell phones and other tablets. Again, for the money, it's a great value for a small tablet."
fireboos1,4,great for kids,works great for me. good for first time user. good for money as well.
Tarheelval,5,Affordable e-reader,I own the Kindle Fire HD 6 and love it...this is a Christmas gift for a friend. Hopefully she will love it. Great price
Firemanprice,5,Son loves it,"My son just loves his Fire tablet. Easy for him to setup to his liking. Can't beat the price either. At the time of the review it was $34.99. If you have kids, this makes a great gift for them."
sexymarie,4,great,Awesome it was great it was a lot of good apps I reccomend it
ComputerGyal,5,Replaced my kindle touch,"I updated my kindle touch to this. I loved the price. I got it a few months ago for $50, which is still an affordable price for a kindle. I love the Bluetooth and text to speech features coupled with the fact that it has an expandable drive. Those features along with the price were what I needed. Oh did I mention the resolution for watching movies is good. The camera is not the best, but I didn't get this for the camera. Matter of fact I got one on Black Friday as a Christmas gift for a friend."
OBU86,2,Dead/Stuck Pixels Galore!,"I didn't expect a lot at this price, but I also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with dead/stuck pixels right out of the box. I have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that I am at least good for 1/3. Waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for return/replacement just in case that one needs to go as well. Maybe just bad luck, but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a return.Everything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues, but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been corrected.I am sure if you don't have these display issues that the product deserves more than 2 stars, but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being. If the display did not have these pixel issues I could see this easily being a 4 Star recommendation. If you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others, so this is not just a rare incident. If it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location, do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home. :)"
Catlin,4,A good simple tablet,"I bought this intending to use it as a music and video player, so I can save battery for my phone. We got two, one for me one for my child. Mine works perfectly for what I bought it. All my music is on it with no problem. I did have to download an app to play my WMA files, but that was simple enough. My child's tablet is primarily used for app games, and I am told it is working just fine."
Scarycarey,2,Good tablet for kids,Ok tablet...decent size screen & graphics. Was hoping I could mirror my phone to it but it doesn't have miracast.
Brandon,5,Great price,"We bought this for our 3 year old because she enjoys playing games on my IPad. This is a much cheaper alternative should she drop it. Android apps so she can get most of the same games and apps. Timer apps available so I haven't checked to see if you can limit time on the device itself. Bonus is the size, it is perfect for her."
RahulHAB,4,Very good tablet for $35,"I was skeptical about the Fire OS, apart from being a Windows Phone user and then used Android a little on Nexus Tab, I found FIre OS a little annoying and not easy to use. But then just after 2-3 tries you get used to of and works fine. The tab is fast with Quad core processor and good RAM. I was thinking to install Android, I bought two of these so the one which I want to gift someone I'll install Android it, Although I myself will try FIre OS for a while and then decide."
Reds,1,Not for a beginner.,"We bought this Kindle Fire for our autistic grandson. He seemed to fight with it trying to connect to the internet. After 3 adults tried and tried to connect it to the internet, it finally connected. Every time he comes to our house, we have to fight again to get it connected. We decided this was not the unit for him or any other kid. So, its back to the mini I-Pad."
Hari,3,Average Performance - Dont Expect too much,This is an average performance tablet and amazon centric. This tablet could have been better if amazon would have made it with android os instead of poorly designed fire OS. The app store and apps in that are not great. This tablet can be good for people who wants to read while travel or play some games while travel will be good. I paid only 35$ so cant complain for the price i paid. I already have ipad mini 2 and comparing with that makes this tablet little slow.
Balip,4,Great product at this price,"I like to refer this product for low budget tablet future owner. It has all the features needed in tablet at lower price. Good display, long battery life, good wifi connection, better speed"
di02,4,Great tablet for a new user,This will be the perfect Christmas gift for my grandson who loves to use his little sisters tablet. Easy to use and very reasonable price.
heidi,5,great for kids,My son loves it. Very easy to use. Great price and value.
nanagail,1,"Light wieght, camera, good price, but not for me","Could not download my books at home. Three visits to Best Buy, returned it."
Fidel,5,Great tablet for the price,Tablet is perfect for someone who needs it does what it needs to do .I bought it specifically to add music to it and sync it to my trucks radio ... Works flawlessly
jeremy25,5,its a good one,i like this because i have one to and i love it.and i will never ever get rid of it i been wanting one and now i have one and my mom has one and her man has one and we all like them and they are easy to use.
kato,4,very good tablet for the price,this is my first tablet/iphone. It was confusing to learn how to navigate. after a few days of fustrution and watch/reading help sections I figured it out. there are alot of feature and apps I have yet to explore. I use it mainly to read and watch movies at work. I like it very much.
rlopezt,5,For the price is an excellent Choice!,"Amazon Fire is an excellent choice and cost effective, havent had any troubles, it works perfect!"
drazthegr8,5,Ridiculous value for the money,"This device is pretty no-frills, but for a 7 year old boy, it works great and is awesome. It's sturdy, plays apps well, and I don't have to freak out every time he drops it. I'm sure it will break eventually (my son will find a way), but for $50, I'll take my chanes."
classylooks,5,Awesome,got this on black friday and couldn't be any happier! for 35 bucks and its a kindle my kids will be super excited.
Mike,5,bang for the buck,"$35 tablet, its a no brainer. great gift for the kids"
lucaya6,4,Nice Little Tablet,This a very good little tablet for my young boys to use
Danny,4,Perfect for kids,"Perfect for kids to play, read online through wi-fi. Touch response is a bit slow."
Shell,5,Very pleased with the price for this tablet.,I really enjoy this Kindle Fire. The ability for expanding the storage is a life saver.
OrangeTX,3,good for price,"Tablet is ok. It does display ads on the lock screen, that you can't opt out of, to my knowledge. But for the price, I can't really complain. I bought it at the $35 BF price. I wouldn't let me download Instagram for some reason either."
jesshadster28,5,Great tablet for a beginner,This product definitely gets the job done plus more! Plus I couldn't beat the low price offered by Best Buy!
BillyG,4,Quality tablet,Great tablet for the price. Much better than the cheaper brands.
Kdac1313,5,Perfect for my 4 year old,This was perfect for my 4 year old. She gets all the apps she wants and it works great. Even dropped it a couple times and it ls still in one piece!
suzy,2,Not happy with the overall performance of product.,Not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up. Not a big fan of the online tutorial. Had a really hard time in powering it off. Camera setting did not take very good pictures. DID NOT LIKE THE MULTIPLE ADS ON IT EVERY TIME I USED IT. FINALLY IT LOCKED UP ON ME AND I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO GO TO SETTINGS SO I COULD DO ANYTHING WITH IT. Probably will be returning this product to Best Buy.
simplesal,4,Great Entry level Fire,Great Speed. Nice Graphics. Really love this Fire.
srik,2,Product for Kids and not for Elders,This product is a beginner product for Kids and nothing to be of use for Elders

Sciencespice,5,Excellent value,"If you have Amazon Prime, this is an excellent way to view content in a small, quality device."
redfeather,3,kindle used as a kids tablet,Well primarily I was going. To for a Samsung galaxy but for the price I went with this kindle for my daughter to use I do like the parental control features I just wish Amazon was a full android device instead of limitations to app markets I can't even get Google play. Unless you jail break it. Well for what it does it works fine just not the top of the list.
dchvic,4,Great value for $50,"A tablet with front/rear facing camera, bluetooth, external storage option, for just $50 is a great deal in my opinion. I use this tablet to play baby rhymes for my 18 month old son, in the car."
Angel,5,Great,Love reading on my Kindle. So many book selections.
bonnies1103,5,I finally got a Kindle!!,I have wanted an inexpensive tablet for awhile and my wife surprised me with this Kindle for my birthday. It's perfect for my needs.
esrozen,3,Ok but definitely not great,Amazon adds are annoying. Lack of compatibility with Google and other apps is annoying. Price is great. Nice to have but it really isn't better than other tablets out there.

MMdz,5,Great Buy,Had to buy two for each kid of mine. They absolutely love it.
Soul,2,Exactly $50 worth of tablet,"First, bought it 15 days before it went on sale everywhere. Next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay $15 to disable them. Performance is slow; keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. Watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. It drops WiFi more than I'm used to. Have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. Good battery kifre, but Quite slow to recharge. Sometimes the ""keys"" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. Thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.I got $50 worth of tablet.Compared to the look and feel of my old iPad, its like I'm still using a VCR and everyone else is on blue ray."
MommyOF3,5,Great tablet for kids,"My 6year old twin boys loves technology and the Fire 7 Tablet is perfect for them. Just the right size to sit and play or pack and go. The icons are super easy to understand for beginners as such. I've downloaded fun games, apps, and books for them to utilize already. The price was awesome as well especially since I purchased two at the same time."
gabby,5,BLACK FRIDAY BABY!,"I got this for a Christmas present for my son, but couldn't help myself. It's awesome. Looks like momma is rewrapping for him, or buying another :D"
Jiggymom,5,great for children,So easy to use grandson loves it nice starter tablet
xyooj,4,Nice simple tablet,"It's not HD but it does the job: Facebook, recipes in the kitchen, streaming Spotify and pandora, Bluetooth is nice."
becbec,4,slightly disappointed kindle lover,"I've purchased several kindles over the years & this is the only one that has given me issues. Purchased this one & exchanged it. I Eventually exchanged the exchange for the same reason. The first two kindles didn't want to turn on & would freeze. So far this one hasn't had any issues what so ever & does everything my mother needs it for (downloading thousands of books & watching videos non-stop)Docked a star due to complications with the first two. If I have to visit a store within the first month of a purchase twice, that is an issue."
Termanator,5,Awesome,MThere are so many cool features and it's really easy to use.
Anonymous,5,Great tablet for this price,"Love this tablet! It does everything! Accesses the web, downloads apps, games, music, movies,. You name it. I also purchased a cover and stylus pens for this tablet. For under $80 you wont find a better deal!"
Crash,5,Great for kids,I bought this tablet for my 7 year old. Great beginner tablet.
comfortablynumb,3,Numerous stuck pixels,"I purchased the new Kindle Tablet not really knowing what to expect..I didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did I try the one in store. After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run. It's not a power house per-se but for what it's built for, consumption device, it does everything from play movies, music and casual games with out a hitch. The UI is realitivley snappy as well.Pros:- Price- IPS Screen viewable at most angles- Works well with the Amazon eco systemCons:- Mono sound (1 speaker poorly placed on back of unit)- Stuck Pixels out of the box- Low Resolution- Device registration issuesIn closing I would recommend to friends as long as they understand it's limitations."
Customer14228,4,Great buy,"I was looking for a good, cheap tablet for general use, and this fit the bill. The one thing that hits you outright is the build-in marketing Amazon uses in the tablet that you cannot remove. For instance, the home screen is filled with links for Amazon Video, Amazon Books, Amazon Gifts, etc, etc. You an't remove them, but I found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them.After that, install a free app for a File Manager then go in and rename the folder(s) that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide. You will also need to install Adobe Reader to read PDF files, since it isn't installed.Another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it. After a while though you get to ignore it.Performance is great - fast and easy to navigate. The built-in browser has everything you should need. Battery life looks really good. I had the screen brightness at about 1/2 power and it looked good. The screen black level is really good and the contrast makes the colors sparkle. If you turn the brightness up too high, the colors begin to wash out a little.Amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotions of Amazon products. Once you get around that, you see the value you get in this tablet."
RockKitKit,1,Nice Amazon Fire,Nice Amazon Fire tablet But...the camera is not clear enough 2.0 megapixels and Amazon Fire is very slow wedsite and app it takes very forever download I think I have to returned on best buy and buy a good tablet 10.1 Lenovo and Samsung Galaxy...I will gave a Zero Rating Star
Rush2,3,"Works, just view appstore 1st","It works great. Not affected by the singular WiFi band at all.Battery life is amazing.Just be sure you can get the apps you'd like from the appstore, google play isn't accessible. So if you're looking for Snapchat, Instagram, NBC, Comcast, Vudu, you won't get those here.Returning it. Which is too bad, I really enjoyed it. More bang for the buck if you could access those apps. But like I said, it was my fault for not checking first. I was expecting the 'apps from unknown sources' to kick in but it so didn't."
doop22,5,Can't beat it for the money,Does the job.Does the job.......................great
vetty11,2,good price,just bought it and not really happy i really expected more from amazon
MK555,2,A nice tablet for books. That's really it.,"Apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing. I'm telling you, generic tablets are faster... I thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. I first noticed this after I started using it but I thought I would give it a shot. I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand. The games are nice and mostly ad free. It uses Android 5.0 but uses their own app store. Reading books is great. Library app is kinda slow but still works.Perfect cheap tablet for kids age 6 to 13 maybe..."
Airmax9ty,5,Cant go wrong,"You cant go wrong with this tablet. I use this for media consumption but mainly for my 8month old baby to bring around and play nursery rhymes. Had a 4gb micro sd laying around, filled it with videos and downloaded a video player app. No more worrying about losing an ipad or my phone tied up with playing his videos. Get the 16$ 2 yr warranty from amazon too. Theyll replace tablet 3 times within 2 yrs no questions ask."
Timothy,4,Love it,Bought for my 3 year old so she could be like her older sisters and this little device doesn't disappoint. I wish there were more silicone cases available for it and I absolutely can't stand the ads Amazon puts on these Fire tablets.
jujy,4,Great for kids,I bought this tablet for my son (10 years old) and he loves it perfect price and size for him... With Amazon's underground app store he has almost unlimited amounts of free games he can download and also movies with the external storage is perfect.
Mrwright,5,Great tablet for kids,The kindle fire works really well for my sone he is learning a lot
wlutz,4,A Bargain,"Let's be perfectly clear, this is not an IPAD. But for $50.00 this 7"" Fire is a steal. I'm very happy with this purchase."
Readymadekid,5,Kindle,For the price I paid not having HD on the kindle was no matter. Has lots of storage and the kids are using it at school for their class assignments. Screen is big enough to read off of and everything is loading fairly fast. Kindle looks to be durable.
SimpleGirl74,4,Great price!,"I do most of my things on my laptop but I wanted something to use while watching TV and so on. I saw this tablet and had to look twice because I thought maybe it was just a reader! I have used this installing apps, playing games, reading, texting on a free text app, Facebooking and so on. The apps are a little sluggish to install but once they are on they are speedy and work well. The clearness of the screen is so much better than any low line tablet at this price range. The tablet feels of good quality. It is not flimsy and cheap feeling. We bought two and are extremely happy. The trick is not to expect it to run like and upper line tablet. Love it for what it is ;)"
SESESE,1,Price is low. Quality is lower than others..,"I purchased this amazon fire. Because, Reviews are good. But, I realized they left reviews before they receive it.I found couple of issues not to buy this tablet.1. It is impossible to use google account.Even You can log in gmail account.2. Bad for web surfing. There are so many limits for web surfing.3.This issue is only for Koreans. It is impossible to type & see Korean language.Do not buy this tablet if you are Korean.I do not know why this tablet does not support Korean. Even supports other Asian countries languages as like Chinese, Japanese. Etc...."
weaver,2,Cheap but appears Wifi is inadequate,the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data. Perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later SW update but for now I have to say the performance is underwhelming. the Backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship. The fire 7 HD which i also own has none of these issues. Get what you pay for rings true again.
Shairy,5,Great,"Great price. My kids (5 years old) love it, they can download games and browse the web without a problem."
gravyboy,5,great value for amazon prime members,"a solid well made tablet that feels good in the hand. images are crisp & clean. works well with my hulu acct, hbogo acct, prime video acct too. the first few secs the video is blurry, then it clears up and plays fine. if you add a sd card the tablet automatically places apps & video on the sd card (if app allows) the great value for me is you can download amazon prime video (must be a current member) onto the sd card for offline viewing. i bet a lot of parents will love that for those long car trips. sound is good. BT worked well with my BT enabled stereo ( i streamed prime music & pandora). don't be put off by the screen resolution - it looks great. the new bellini OS is a MAJOR improvement over the old carousel format of days past. the new amazon app underground also adds to the value for prime members. the lock screen ads are not intrusive, once you swipe to unlock tablet they go away and do not reappear until you lock the screen again. if you're a prime member - this is the best 50 bucks you will spend!"
MisterD,2,Damaged Screen,"The Fire 7 has a great price! You get your money's worth. However, you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one. The one I bought had a busted pixel in the screen. There was no damage to the case or glass screen, but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen's image. I've owned multiple, but I have never had this problem before with an ePad tablet when I just bought it. I will now have to visit Best Buy again tomorrow for an exchange. I'm hoping they're still in stock. It's not Best Buy's fault. The fault lies with Amazon. They're clearly not that durable."
DrJay,5,Amazon tablet for $50?! No brainer!,This is a name brand tablet for less than the case of other tablets! This is a no brainer and will make great Christmas gifts!
apriltaylor322,5,Lov my computer,"I've was married to the same man for 30 something yrs and they was the best time in my life we have kids that's all grown and they have kids now. I love them deeply but they all are upset with me because they haven't had a Christmas ,I always get my Grand kids something but it hasn't happen in 3 yrs. I can't seem to be able to afford it any more I thought the kids would love the tablet I know they will because they all stay on computer like me it's educational for them and my self. I'm disable and have nothing to do so"
blackpagoda,4,Rad,"Simple and deluxe, functions well and holds up- even with kids and their paws. Its layout and usability a bit confusing at first. Watch out for amazon add ons to charge your account though."
blowtorch,5,excellent,"it is excellent. easy to use. kids use it easily. durable, been dropped a few times and still works"
Jdwalker,4,Good bang for the buck,Works smooth and easy will recommend to friends and family
Hank,4,Very good.,Works well for my purposes. Wanted a calendar and contact list so all of the other things are a bonus.
Kchu8813,3,Kind of slow but decent overall,I don't care for the lack of storage or the strange arrangement and naviagation through the software. Nonetheless it's nice for its price
Scott,4,Good tablet for the price,"I bought these fore my grandkids, and they love them"
Sailor0411,1,Battery Port Sucks,The kids were loving these as Christmas gifts but here we are 6 months later and the battery charging port barely even works. We have to hold the charging cable at a certain angle for it to even charge. I wasn't expecting a super long life out of these tablets at $39.99 a pop but should've lasted longer than 5-6 months. Very upset with 4 sad kiddos.
KZ007,5,Great alternative desktop,If you're looking for an android alternative to a Windows-based desktop this makes a great option
JjjY,5,Great price,Great tablet for the price. Got it for my daughter. She loves it.
Ronh,4,Great,My 11 year old loves it and does a lot more than just games on it
angusmf,4,Great for the money,"According to my girlfriend, it is slow, but functional for simple things like web and watching TV. I bought it for game development testing and have been satisfied. Seems like an very good piece of hardware for only $50. Suspect amazon keeps the price low because they intend to make their money on selling you content through their locked-down store. It is an android tablet, but most of the google software you're used to is not there, which is the biggest downfall."
jlvm,4,Good for the money,"Cool little tablet. Does what you would expect a tablet would do. Screen quality isn't the greatest, but you get what you pay for."
Benny,4,Great product for the $$$,"Have 2 younger kids always trying to grab my cell or tablets for stuff. Grabbed up 2 of these and was pleasantly surprised. Hold charge well, durable, and perfect for kids and learning apps"
brandon95g,4,Great tablet for the money,Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Great value for the money
Mcgregor,5,Birthday gift,"Bought this for my Aunt and she loves it so much, she uses it everyday and says its very easy to use."
Justin,4,nice cheap tablet,"outclasses other tablets at this price point, only downside is the need to use the Amazon App Store instead of the normal Google Play Store. Great tablet for the kids though."
CorporateMom,4,Great $40 gift that means a lot more,"Everytime I give one of these as a gift, it is worth so much more than the $40 I paid for it. Durable and lasts a really long time. Great for kids."
Mike,5,Great tablet,Great tablet for price. Upgraded my son to this after we ran out of space on the Kid Fire.
Kay2,4,ASUS,I purchased an ASUS 2 in 1. I love it. It was so much easier to switch all my documents and load programs from my other PC. The only problem I had was the facial recognition. It kept saying it did not recognize me and got locked up. Customer Service was very nice and got me going again.
TVStHelenaIsland,4,Decent value for a low price point.,"Very basic tablet which I purchased mostly as an e-reader. It's battery life is quite short. As a reader it is poor in the sunlight. I'd recommend if the price point is important, but you get what you pay for."
honey,3,tab,got it to play games or get info when waiting at dr app
4321,4,Works. Can't beat the price,It does most everything the higher priced tablets do. The advertising is annoying. It's possible to combine all of the icons for stuff you never use or want into one icon file.
gr8minds99,4,Very easy set up,It is everything it promised. I use it to download books.
Jones,3,Nice tablet for my 12 year old,Bought it as birthday gift for my son. He didn't like it at first because he is ise to the Android system. He likes it more now that he's figured it out and for the price it's ok.
Jpac,5,Great product,This is great for kids and adult. A great product for gaming reading and more..
Anna,4,Tablet for my kids,"My kids already broke two of my tablets. So, I want one specifically for my kids. This Amazon Fire 7 fits my needs. I'm happy with my purchase."
